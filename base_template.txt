   1. Reduction of a Letter of Credit
      1. If, on the proposed Utilisation Date of a Letter of Credit, any Lender under the Revolving Facility is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and:
         1. that Lender has failed to provide cash collateral to the Issuing Bank in accordance with Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover); and
         2. the Borrower of that proposed Letter of Credit has not exercised its right to provide cash cover to the Issuing Bank in accordance with paragraph (g) of Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover),
the Issuing Bank may reduce the amount of that Letter of Credit by an amount equal to the amount of the participation of that Non-Acceptable L/C Lender in respect of that Letter of Credit and that Non-Acceptable L/C Lender shall be deemed not to have any participation (or obligation to indemnify the Issuing Bank) in respect of that Letter of Credit for the purposes of the Finance Documents.
      1. The Issuing Bank shall notify the Agent and the Parent of each reduction made pursuant to this Clause 6.7.
      2. This Clause 6.7 shall not affect the participation of each other Lender in that Letter of Credit.
   1. Revaluation of Letters of Credit
      1. If any Letters of Credit are denominated in an Optional Currency, the Agent shall [at six monthly intervals after the date of this Agreement,]/[at six monthly intervals after the date of the Letter of Credit],/[[   ] days after the end of [each of its Financial Years]/[each half of each of its Financial Years]] recalculate the Base Currency Amount of each Letter of Credit by notionally converting into the Base Currency the outstanding amount of that Letter of Credit on the basis of the Agent's Spot Rate of Exchange on the date of calculation.
      2. The Parent shall, if requested by the Agent within [     ] days of any calculation under paragraph (a) above, ensure that within three Business Days sufficient Revolving Facility Utilisations are prepaid to prevent the Base Currency Amount of the Revolving Facility Utilisations exceeding the Total Revolving Facility Commitments (after deducting the total Ancillary Commitments) following any adjustment to a Base Currency Amount under paragraph (a) above.
   1. Reduction or expiry of Letter of Credit
If the amount of any Letter of Credit is wholly or partially reduced or it is repaid or prepaid or it expires prior to its Expiry Date, the relevant Issuing Bank and the Borrower that requested (or on behalf of which the Parent requested) the issue of that Letter of Credit shall promptly notify the Agent of the details upon becoming aware of them.
   1. Appointment of additional Issuing Banks
Any Lender which has agreed to the Parent's request to be an Issuing Bank for the purposes of this Agreement shall become a Party as an "Issuing Bank" upon notifying the Agent and the Parent that it has so agreed to be an Issuing Bank.
1. LETTERS OF CREDIT
   1. Immediately payable
If a Letter of Credit or any amount outstanding under a Letter of Credit is expressed to be immediately payable, the Borrower that requested (or on behalf of which the Parent requested) the issue of that Letter of Credit shall repay or prepay that amount immediately.
   1. Claims under a Letter of Credit
      1. Each Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally authorises the Issuing Bank to pay any claim made or purported to be made under a Letter of Credit requested by it (or requested by the Parent on its behalf) and which appears on its face to be in order (in this Clause 7, a "claim").
      2. Each Borrower shall immediately on demand pay to the Agent for the Issuing Bank an amount equal to the amount of any claim.
      3. Each Borrower acknowledges that the Issuing Bank:
         1. is not obliged to carry out any investigation or seek any confirmation from any other person before paying a claim; and
         2. deals in documents only and will not be concerned with the legality of a claim or any underlying transaction or any available set-off, counterclaim or other defence of any person.
      1. The obligations of a Borrower under this Clause 7 will not be affected by:
         1. the sufficiency, accuracy or genuineness of any claim or any other document; or
         2. any incapacity of, or limitation on the powers of, any person signing a claim or other document.
   1. Indemnities
      1. Each Borrower shall immediately on demand indemnify the Issuing Bank against any cost, loss or liability incurred by the Issuing Bank (otherwise than by reason of the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or wilful misconduct) in acting as the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit requested by (or on behalf of) that Borrower.
      2. Each Lender shall (according to its L/C Proportion) immediately on demand indemnify the Issuing Bank against any cost, loss or liability incurred by the Issuing Bank (otherwise than by reason of the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or wilful misconduct) in acting as the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (unless the Issuing Bank has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to a Finance Document).
      3. The Borrower which requested (or on behalf of which the Parent requested) a Letter of Credit shall immediately on demand reimburse any Lender for any payment it makes to the Issuing Bank under this Clause 7.3 in respect of that Letter of Credit.
      4. The obligations of each Lender or Borrower under this Clause 7 are continuing obligations and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by that Lender or Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
      5. If a Borrower has provided cash cover in respect of a Lender's participation in a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall seek reimbursement from that cash cover before making a demand of that Lender under paragraph (b) above.  Any recovery made by an Issuing Bank pursuant to that cash cover will reduce that Lender's liability under paragraph (b) above.
      6. The obligations of any Lender or Borrower under this Clause will not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any other person) including:
         1. any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or any other person;
         2. the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor or any member of the Group;
         3. the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;
         4. any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or any other person;
         5. any amendment (however fundamental) or replacement of a Finance Document, any Letter of Credit or any other document or security[39];
         6. any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document, any Letter of Credit or any other document or security; or
         7. any insolvency or similar proceedings.
   1. Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover
      1. If, at any time, a Lender under the Revolving Facility is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender, the Issuing Bank may, by notice to that Lender, request that Lender to pay and that Lender shall pay, on or prior to the date falling [       ] Business Days after the request by the Issuing Bank, an amount equal to that Lender's L/C Proportion of:
         1. the outstanding amount of a Letter of Credit; or
         2. in the case of a proposed Letter of Credit, the amount of that proposed Letter of Credit,
and in the currency of that Letter of Credit to an interest-bearing account held in the name of that Lender with the Issuing Bank. [40]
      1. The Non-Acceptable L/C Lender to whom a request has been made in accordance with paragraph (a) above shall enter into a security document or other form of collateral arrangement over the account, in form and substance satisfactory to the Issuing Bank, as collateral for any amounts due and payable under this Agreement by that Lender to the Issuing Bank in respect of that Letter of Credit.
      2. Subject to paragraph (f) below, withdrawals from such an account may only be made to pay the Issuing Bank amounts due and payable to it under this Agreement by the Non-Acceptable L/C Lender in respect of that Letter of Credit until no amount is or may be outstanding under that Letter of Credit.
      3. Each Lender under the Revolving Facility shall notify the Agent and the Parent:
         1. on the date of this Agreement or on any later date on which it becomes such a Lender in accordance with Clause 2.3 (Increase) or Clause 30 (Changes to the Lenders) whether it is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender; and
         2. as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the same, that it has become a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender,
and an indication in Schedule 1 (The Original Parties), in a Transfer Certificate, in an Assignment Agreement or in an Increase Confirmation to that effect will constitute a notice under paragraph (i) above to the Agent and, upon delivery in accordance with Clause 30.8 (Copy of Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation to Parent), to the Parent.
      1. Any notice received by the Agent pursuant to paragraph (d) above shall constitute notice to the Issuing Bank of that Lender's status and the Agent shall, upon receiving each such notice, promptly notify the Issuing Bank of that Lender's status as specified in that notice.
      2. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) above, a Lender which has provided cash collateral in accordance with this Clause 7.4 may, by notice to the Issuing Bank, request that an amount equal to the amount provided by it as collateral in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit (together with any accrued interest) be returned to it:
         1. to the extent that such cash collateral has not been applied in satisfaction of any amount due and payable under this Agreement by that Lender to the Issuing Bank in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit;
         2. if:
            1. it ceases to be a NonAcceptable L/C Lender;
            2. its obligations in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit are transferred to a New Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or
            3. an Increase Lender has agreed to undertake that Lender's obligations in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and
         1. if no amount is due and payable by that Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit,
and the Issuing Bank shall pay that amount to the Lender within [ ] Business Days of that Lender's request (and shall cooperate with the Lender in order to procure that the relevant security or collateral arrangement is released and discharged).
      1. To the extent that a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender fails to provide cash collateral (or notifies the Issuing Bank that it will not provide cash collateral) in accordance with this Clause 7.4 in respect of a proposed Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Parent (with a copy to the Agent) and the Borrower of that proposed Letter of Credit may, at any time before the proposed Utilisation Date of that Letter of Credit[41], provide cash cover to an account with the Issuing Bank in an amount equal to that Lender's L/C Proportion of the amount of that proposed Letter of Credit.
   1. Requirement for cash cover from Borrower
If:
      1. a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender fails to provide cash collateral (or notifies the Issuing Bank that it will not provide cash collateral) in accordance with Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover) in respect of a Letter of Credit that has been issued;
      2. the Issuing Bank notifies the Parent (with a copy to the Agent) that it requires the Borrower of the relevant Letter of Credit to provide cash cover to an account with the Issuing Bank in an amount equal to that Lender's L/C Proportion of the outstanding amount of that Letter of Credit; and
      3. that Borrower has not already provided such cash cover which is continuing to stand as collateral,
then that Borrower shall provide such cash cover within [ ] Business Days of the notice referred to in paragraph (b) above.
   1. Regulation and consequences of cash cover provided by Borrower
      1. Any cash cover provided by a Borrower pursuant to Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover) or Clause 7.5 (Requirement for cash cover from Borrower) may be funded out of a Revolving Facility Loan.
      2. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of Clause 1.2 (Construction), the relevant Borrower may request that an amount equal to the cash cover (together with any accrued interest) provided by it pursuant to Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover) or Clause 7.5 (Requirement for cash cover from Borrower) be returned to it:
         1. to the extent that such cash cover has not been applied in satisfaction of any amount due and payable under this Agreement by that Borrower to the Issuing Bank in respect of a Letter of Credit;
         2. if:
            1. the relevant Lender ceases to be a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender; 
            2. the relevant Lender's obligations in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit are transferred to a New Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or
            3. an Increase Lender has agreed to undertake the relevant Lender's obligations in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and
         1. if no amount is due and payable by the relevant Lender in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit,
and the Issuing Bank shall pay that amount to that Borrower within [   ] Business Days of that Borrower's request.[42]
      1. To the extent that a Borrower has provided cash cover pursuant to Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover) or Clause 7.5 (Requirement for cash cover from Borrower), the relevant Lender's L/C Proportion in respect of that Letter of Credit will remain (but that Lender's obligations in relation to that Letter of Credit may be satisfied in accordance with paragraph (e)(ii) of Clause 1.2 (Construction)). However the relevant Borrower's obligation to pay any Letter of Credit fee in relation to the relevant Letter of Credit to the Agent (for the account of that Lender) in accordance with paragraph (b) of Clause 18.5 (Fees payable in respect of Letters of Credit) will be reduced proportionately as from the date on which it provides that cash cover (and for so long as the relevant amount of cash cover continues to stand as collateral).
      2. The relevant Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent of the extent to which a Borrower provides cash cover pursuant to Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover) or Clause 7.5 (Requirement for cash cover from Borrower) and of any change in the amount of cash cover so provided.

   1. Unavailability of a currency
If before the Specified Time on any Quotation Day:
      1. a Lender notifies the Agent that the Optional Currency requested is not readily available to it in the amount required; or
      2. a Lender notifies the Agent that compliance with its obligation to participate in a Loan in the proposed Optional Currency would contravene a law or regulation applicable to it,
the Agent will give notice to the relevant Borrower [or Parent] to that effect by the Specified Time on that day.  In this event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this Clause 8.2 will be required to participate in the Loan in the Base Currency (in an amount equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount, or in respect of a Rollover Loan, an amount equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount of the Rollover Loan that is due to be made) and its participation will be treated as a separate Loan denominated in the Base Currency during that Interest Period.
   1. Agent's calculations
Each Lender's participation in a Loan will be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of Clause 5.4 (Lenders' participation).
1. ANCILLARY FACILITIES

         2. may allow only Borrowers [(or Affiliates of Borrowers nominated pursuant to Clause 9.9 (Affiliates of Borrowers))] to use the Ancillary Facility;
         3. may not allow the Ancillary Outstandings to exceed the Ancillary Commitment;
         4. may not allow a Lender's Ancillary Commitment to exceed that Lender's Available Commitment relating to the Revolving Facility (before taking into account the effect of the Ancillary Facility on that Available Commitment); and
         5. must require that the Ancillary Commitment is reduced to zero, and that all Ancillary Outstandings are repaid not later than the Termination Date applicable to the Revolving Facility (or such earlier date as the Revolving Facility Commitment of the relevant Ancillary Lender (or its Affiliate) is reduced to zero).

      2. If an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility is a contingent liability and that contingent liability becomes an actual liability or is reduced to zero after the original adjustment is made under paragraph (b) above, then each Lender and Ancillary Lender will make a further adjustment (by making or receiving (as the case may be) corresponding transfers of rights and obligations under the Finance Documents relating to Revolving Outstandings to the extent necessary) to put themselves in the position they would have been in had the original adjustment been determined by reference to the actual liability or, as the case may be, zero liability and not the contingent liability.
      3. Any transfer of rights and obligations relating to Revolving Outstandings made pursuant to this Clause 9.6 shall be made for a purchase price in cash, payable at the time of transfer, in an amount equal to those Revolving Outstandings [(less any accrued interest, fees and commission to which the transferor will remain entitled to receive notwithstanding that transfer, pursuant to Clause 30.11 (Pro rata interest settlement))]. 
      4. [Prior to the application of the provisions of paragraph (b) above, an Ancillary Lender that has provided a Multi-account Overdraft shall set-off any Available Credit Balance on any account comprised in that Multi-account Overdraft.]
      5. All calculations to be made pursuant to this Clause 9.6 shall be made by the Agent based upon information provided to it by the Lenders and Ancillary Lenders and the Agent's Spot Rate of Exchange.
      6. [This Clause 9.6 shall not oblige any Lender to accept the transfer of a claim relating to an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility which is not denominated (pursuant to the relevant Finance Document) in either the Base Currency, a currency which has been an Optional Currency for the purpose of any Revolving Facility Utilisation or in another currency which is acceptable to that Lender.]][44]

      2. The Parent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Lender in any notice delivered by the Parent to the Agent pursuant to paragraph  (b)(i) of Clause 9.2 (Availability).
      3.

      4. [If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and obligations to a New Lender, its Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.]
      5. Where this Agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on an Ancillary Lender and the relevant Ancillary Lender is an Affiliate of a Lender which is not a party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.]
   1. [Affiliates of Borrowers

      4. Where this Agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.
      5. Any reference in this Agreement or any other Finance Document to a Borrower being under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Finance Document shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a Borrower being under no obligations under any Finance Document or Ancillary Document.]
   1. Revolving Facility Commitment amounts
Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, each Lender shall ensure that at all times its Revolving Facility Commitment is not less than[:
      1. ]its Ancillary Commitment[; or
      2. the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate].
   1. Amendments and Waivers – Ancillary Facilities
No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility shall require the consent of any Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or waiver itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this Clause 9).  In such a case, Clause 42 (Amendments and Waivers) will apply.

            3. in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing Revolving Facility Loan; and

      1. [At any time when a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the maturity date of each of the participations of that Lender in the Revolving Facility Loans then outstanding will be automatically extended to [the last day of the Availability Period applicable to the Revolving Facility]/ [the Termination Date applicable to the Revolving Facility] and will be treated as separate Revolving Facility Loans (the "Separate Loans") denominated in the currency in which the relevant participations are outstanding.
      2. [If the Borrower makes a prepayment of a Revolving Facility Utilisation pursuant to Clause 12.5 (Voluntary prepayment of Revolving Facility Utilisations),] a Borrower to whom a Separate Loan is outstanding may prepay that Loan by giving not less than [    ] Business Days' prior notice to the Agent.  [The proportion borne by the amount of the prepayment of the Separate Loan to the amount of the Separate Loans shall not exceed the proportion borne by the amount of the prepayment of the Revolving Facility Utilisation to the Revolving Facility Utilisations.] The Agent will forward a copy of a prepayment notice received in accordance with this paragraph (d) to the Defaulting Lender concerned as soon as practicable on receipt.
      3. Interest in respect of a Separate Loan will accrue for successive Interest Periods selected by the Borrower by the time and date specified by the Agent (acting reasonably) and will be payable by that Borrower to the Agent (for the account of that Defaulting Lender) on the last day of each Interest Period of that Loan.

   1. Mandatory Prepayment Accounts and Holding Accounts
      1. The Parent shall ensure that:
         1. Disposal Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and Acquisition Proceeds in respect of which the Parent has made an election under paragraph (d) of Clause 13.3 (Application of mandatory prepayments and cancellations) are paid into a Mandatory Prepayment Account as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by a member of the Group;
         2. [Insert details of any amounts of Excluded Disposal Proceeds, Excluded Insurance Proceeds and/or Excluded Acquisition Proceeds to be applied in replacement, reinstatement or repair of assets] are paid into a Holding Account as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by a member of the Group; and
         3. an amount equal to any Excess Cashflow in respect of which the Parent has made an election under paragraph (d) of Clause 13.3 (Application of mandatory prepayments and cancellations) is paid into a Mandatory Prepayment Account promptly after such election.
      1. The Parent and each Borrower irrevocably authorise the Agent to apply:
         1. amounts credited to the Mandatory Prepayment Account; and
         2. amounts credited to the Holding Account [which have not been applied in [            ] within [    ] months of receipt of the relevant proceeds (or such longer time period as the [Agent]/[Majority Lenders] may agree)],
to pay amounts due and payable under Clause 13.3 (Application of mandatory prepayments and cancellations) and otherwise under the Finance Documents.  The Parent and each Borrower further irrevocably authorise the Agent to so apply amounts credited to the Holding Account whether or not [        ] months have elapsed since receipt of those proceeds if a Default has occurred and is continuing.  [The Parent and each Borrower also irrevocably authorise the Agent to transfer any amounts credited to the Holding Account referred to in this paragraph (b) to the Mandatory Prepayment Account pending payment of amounts due and payable under the Finance Documents (but if all such amounts have been paid any such amounts remaining credited to the Mandatory Prepayment Account may (unless a Default has occurred) be transferred back to the Holding Account).]
      1. Each Finance Party with which a Mandatory Prepayment Account or Holding Account is held acknowledges and agrees that (i) interest shall accrue at normal commercial rates on amounts credited to those accounts and that the account holder shall be entitled to receive such interest (which shall be paid in accordance with the mandate relating to such account) unless a Default is continuing and (ii) each such account is subject to the Transaction Security.
   1. Excluded proceeds
[Where Excluded Acquisition Proceeds, Excluded Disposal Proceeds and Excluded Insurance Proceeds include amounts which are intended to be used for a specific purpose within a specified period (as set out in the relevant definition of Excluded Acquisition Proceeds, Excluded Disposal Proceeds or Excluded Insurance Proceeds), the Parent shall ensure that those amounts are used for that purpose and [, if requested to do so by the Agent,] shall promptly deliver a certificate to the Agent at the time of such application and at the end of such period confirming the amount (if any) which has been so applied within the requisite time periods provided for in the relevant definition].
1. RESTRICTIONS

[A Lender may, if it gives the Agent not less than [ ][56] Business Days' prior notice, elect to waive all or a specified part of its share of such a prepayment of Facility B or Facility C [or a Waivable Bullet Incremental Facility] if the amount waived can be applied to reduce [Facility A Loans] [or Incremental Facility Loans under any Incremental Facility which is not a Waivable Bullet Incremental Facility].]
   1. Effect of repayment and prepayment on Commitments
If all or part of any Lender's participation in a Utilisation under a Facility is repaid or prepaid and is not available for redrawing (other than by operation of Clause 4.2 (Further conditions precedent)), an amount of that Lender's Commitment (equal to the Base Currency Amount of the amount of the participation which is repaid or prepaid) in respect of that Facility will be deemed to be cancelled on the date of repayment or prepayment.

SECTION 5
COSTS OF UTILISATION
1. INTEREST
   1. Calculation of interest
The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable:
      1. Margin; [and]
      2. LIBOR [or, in relation to any Loan in euro, EURIBOR][or, in relation to any Loan in a Non-LIBOR Currency, the Benchmark Rate for that currency][; and
      3. Mandatory Cost, if any].
   1. Payment of interest
      1. The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest on that Loan on the last day of each Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the dates falling at six Monthly intervals after the first day of the Interest Period).
      2. [If the Compliance Certificate received by the Agent which relates to the relevant Annual Financial Statements shows that a higher Margin should have applied during a certain period, then the Parent shall (or shall ensure the relevant Borrower shall) promptly pay to the Agent any amounts necessary to put the Agent and the Lenders in the position they would have been in had the appropriate rate of the Margin applied during such period.]
   1. Default interest
      1. If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which, subject to paragraph (b) below, is [   ] per cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the Agent (acting reasonably).  Any interest accruing under this Clause 15.3 shall be immediately payable by the Obligor on demand by the Agent.
      2. If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan:
         1. the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to that Loan; and
         2. the rate of interest applying to the overdue amount during that first Interest Period shall be [   ] per cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have applied if the overdue amount had not become due.
      1. Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.
   1. Notification of rates of interest
      1. The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Lenders and the relevant Borrower (or the Parent) of the determination of a rate of interest under this Agreement.
      2. The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower (or the Parent) of each Funding Rate relating to a Loan.
1. INTEREST PERIODS
   1. Selection of Interest Periods and Terms
      1. A Borrower (or the Parent on behalf of a Borrower) may select an Interest Period for a Loan in the Utilisation Request for that Loan or (if the Loan is a Term Loan and has already been borrowed) in a Selection Notice.
      2. Each Selection Notice for a Term Loan is irrevocable and must be delivered to the Agent by the Borrower (or the Parent on behalf of the Borrower) to which that Term Loan was made not later than the Specified Time.
      3. If a Borrower (or the Parent) fails to deliver a Selection Notice to the Agent in accordance with paragraph (b) above, the relevant Interest Period will, subject to Clause 16.2 (Changes to Interest Periods), be [one] Month[ or, if the Loan is in a Non-LIBOR Currency, the period specified in respect of that currency in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks)].
      4. Subject to this Clause 16, a Borrower (or the Parent) may select an Interest Period of [[   ] or [    ]] Months [if the Loan is not in a Non-LIBOR Currency or, if the Loan is in a Non-LIBOR Currency, of any period specified in respect of that currency in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks)][57] or[, in either case,] of any other period agreed between the Parent, the Agent and all the Lenders in relation to the relevant Loan.  [In addition a Borrower (or the Parent on its behalf) may select an Interest Period of:
         1. (in relation to Facility [A] [B] [C] [an Amortising Incremental Facility]) a period of less than [one] Month, if necessary to ensure that there are [Facility A Loans] [Facility B Loans] [Facility C Loans] [Loans under that Amortising Incremental Facility] (with an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to or greater than the Repayment Instalment) which have an Interest Period ending on a Repayment Date relating to the relevant Facility for the Borrowers to make the Repayment Instalment due on that date; or
         2. (in relation to the Revolving Facility) a period of less than [one] Month, if necessary to ensure that (when aggregated with the Available Facility for the Revolving Facility) there are Revolving Facility Loans (with an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to or greater than the Reduction Instalment) which have an Interest Period ending on a Reduction Date for the scheduled reduction to occur].
      1. An Interest Period for a Loan shall not extend beyond the Termination Date applicable to its Facility.
      2. Each Interest Period for a Term Loan shall start on the Utilisation Date or (if already made) on the last day of its preceding Interest Period.
      3. A Revolving Facility Loan has one Interest Period only.
      4. Prior to the Syndication Date, Interest Periods shall be one Month [or, in the case of a Loan in a Non-LIBOR Currency, the period specified in respect of that currency in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks)] or[, in each case,] such other period as the Agent and the Parent may agree and any Interest Period which would otherwise end during the Month preceding or extend beyond the Syndication Date shall end on the Syndication Date.
   1. Changes to Interest Periods
      1. [Prior to determining the interest rate for a [Facility A Loan] [Facility B Loan] [Facility C Loan] [Loan under an Amortising Incremental Facility], the Agent may shorten an Interest Period for any [Facility A Loan] [Facility B Loan] [Facility C Loan] [Loan under that Amortising Incremental Facility] to ensure there are sufficient [Facility A Loans] [Facility B Loans] [Facility C Loans] [Loans under that Amortising Incremental Facility] (with an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to or greater than the relevant Repayment Instalment) which have an Interest Period ending on the relevant Repayment Date for the Borrowers to make the relevant Repayment Instalment due on that date.]
      2. [Prior to determining the interest rate for a Revolving Facility Loan, the Agent may shorten the Interest Period for any Revolving Facility Loan to ensure that, when aggregated with the Available Facility for the Revolving Facility, there are sufficient Revolving Facility Loans (with an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to or greater than the Reduction Instalment) which have an Interest Period ending on a Reduction Date for the scheduled reduction to occur.]
      3. If the Agent makes any of the changes to an Interest Period referred to in this Clause 16.2, it shall promptly notify the Parent and the Lenders.
   1. Non-Business Days
      1. [Other than where paragraph (b) below applies, if]/[If] an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).
      2. [If the Loan is in a Non-LIBOR Currency and there are rules specified as "Business Day Conventions" for that currency in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks), those rules shall apply to each Interest Period for that Loan.]
   1. Consolidation and division of Term Loans
      1. Subject to paragraph (b) below, if two or more Interest Periods:
         1. relate to:
            1. Facility A Loans made to the same Borrower[; or
            2. Incremental Facility Loans made under the same Incremental Facility and to the same Borrower]; and
         1. end on the same date,
those Facility A Loans [or, as the case may be, Incremental Facility Loans] will, unless that Borrower (or the Parent on its behalf) specifies to the contrary in the Selection Notice for the next Interest Period, be consolidated into, and treated as, a single Facility A Loan [or, as the case may be, a single Incremental Facility Loan,] on the last day of the Interest Period.
      1. Subject to Clause 4.4 (Maximum number of Utilisations), and Clause 5.3 (Currency and amount) if a Borrower (or the Parent on its behalf) requests in a Selection Notice that a Facility A Loan [or an Incremental Facility Loan] be divided into two or more Facility A Loans [or Incremental Facility Loans], that Loan will, on the last day of its Interest Period, be so divided with Base Currency Amounts specified in that Selection Notice, having an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to the Base Currency Amount of the Loan immediately before its division.
1. CHANGES TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST
   1. [Unavailability of Screen Rate [58]
      1. Interpolated Screen Rate:  If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR [or, if applicable, EURIBOR] [or, if applicable, the Benchmark Rate] for the Interest Period of a Loan, the applicable LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] shall be the Interpolated Screen Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan.
      2. Shortened Interest Period:  If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR [or, if applicable, EURIBOR] [or, if applicable, the Benchmark Rate] for:
         1. the currency of a Loan; or
         2. the Interest Period of a Loan and it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Screen Rate,
the Interest Period of that Loan shall (if it is longer than the applicable Fallback Interest Period) be shortened to the applicable Fallback Interest Period and the applicable LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] for that shortened Interest Period shall be determined pursuant to [the definition of "LIBOR"] / [the relevant definition].
      1. Shortened Interest Period and Historic Screen Rate: If the Interest Period of a Loan is, after giving effect to paragraph (b) above, either the applicable Fallback Interest Period or shorter than the applicable Fallback Interest Period and, in either case, no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR [or, if applicable EURIBOR] [or, if applicable, the Benchmark Rate] for:
         1. the currency of that Loan; or
         2. the Interest Period of that Loan and it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Screen Rate,
the applicable LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] shall be the Historic Screen Rate for that Loan.
      1. Shortened Interest Period and Interpolated Historic Screen Rate: If paragraph (c) above applies but no Historic Screen Rate is available for the Interest Period of the Loan, the applicable LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] shall be the Interpolated Historic Screen Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan.
      2. [Reference Bank Rate:] / [Cost of funds:] If paragraph (d) above applies but it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Historic Screen Rate, the Interest Period of that Loan shall, if it has been shortened pursuant to paragraph (b) above, revert to its previous length and [the applicable LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] shall be the Reference Bank Rate as of the Specified Time for the currency of that Loan and for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan] / [there shall be no LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] for that Loan and Clause 17.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to that Loan for that Interest Period].
      3. [Cost of funds: If paragraph (e) above applies but no Reference Bank Rate is available for the relevant currency or Interest Period there shall be no LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] for that Loan and Clause 17.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to that Loan for that Interest Period.]]/
OR
17.1        [Unavailability of Screen Rate

Interpolated Screen Rate: If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR [or, if applicable, EURIBOR] [or, if applicable, the Benchmark Rate] for the Interest Period of a Loan, the applicable LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] shall be the Interpolated Screen Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan.
      2. [Reference Bank Rate:] / [Cost of funds:] If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR [or, if applicable, EURIBOR] [or, if applicable, the Benchmark Rate] for: 
         1. the currency of a Loan; or
         2. the Interest Period of a Loan and it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Screen Rate, 
[the applicable LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] shall be the Reference Bank Rate as of the Specified Time for the currency of that Loan and for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan] / [there shall be no LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or Benchmark Rate] for that Loan and Clause 17.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to that Loan for that Interest Period.].

      1. Subject to paragraph (b) below, if LIBOR [or EURIBOR] [or a Benchmark Rate] is to be determined on the basis of a Reference Bank Rate but a Reference Bank does not supply a quotation by the Specified Time, the Reference Bank Rate shall be calculated on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks.

[the rate notified to the Agent by that Lender] / [the weighted average of the rates notified to the Agent by each Lender] as soon as practicable and in any event [within [    ] Business Days of the first day of that Interest Period]/[by close of business on the date falling [    ] Business Days after the Quotation Day] (or, if earlier, on the date falling [    ] Business Days before the date on which interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period), to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to the relevant Lender of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select[; and
         3. the Mandatory Cost, if any[, applicable to that Lender's participation in the Loan][63]].
      1. If this Clause 17.4 applies and the Agent or the Parent so requires, the Agent and the Parent shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than thirty days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.

         1. a Lender's Funding Rate is less than LIBOR [or, in relation to any Loan in euro, EURIBOR] [or, in relation to any Loan in a Non-LIBOR Currency, the Benchmark Rate]; or 
         2. a Lender does not supply a quotation by the time specified in paragraph (a)(ii) above, 
the cost to that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan for that Interest Period shall be deemed, for the purposes of paragraph (a) above, to be LIBOR [or, in relation to a Loan in euro, EURIBOR] [or, in relation to a Loan in a Non-LIBOR Currency, the Benchmark Rate].
      1. [If this Clause 17.4 applies pursuant to Clause 17.1 (Unavailability of Screen Rate) but any Lender does not supply a quotation by the time specified in paragraph (a)(ii) above the rate of interest shall be calculated on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Lenders.][64]

            2. under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party's Facility Office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction,
if that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Finance Party; or
         1. to the extent a loss, liability or cost:
            1. is compensated for by an increased payment under Clause 19.2 (Tax gross-up); or
            2. would have been compensated for by an increased payment under Clause 19.2 (Tax gross-up) but was not so compensated solely because one of the exclusions in paragraph (d) of Clause 19.2 (Tax gross-up) applied; or

      1. A Protected Party making, or intending to make a claim under paragraph (a) above shall promptly notify the Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which the Agent shall notify the Parent.

      2. that Finance Party has obtained and utilised that Tax Credit,
the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Obligor which that Finance Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Obligor.

      2. a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender); or
      3. a Treaty Lender.
If such a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this Clause 19.5 then that Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Obligor) as if it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Agent which category applies (and the Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Parent).

      1. All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party).
      2. If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the "Supplier") to any other Finance Party (the "Recipient") under a Finance Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the "Relevant Party") is required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):
         1. (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT.  The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and
         2. (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.
      1. Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.
      2. Any reference in this Clause 19.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994)[70].
      3. In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly provide such Finance Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.[71]

            1. a FATCA Exempt Party; or
            2. not a FATCA Exempt Party;

         2. supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime. 
      1. If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.
      2. Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything, and paragraph (a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:
         1. any law or regulation;
         2. any fiduciary duty; or
         3. any duty of confidentiality. 
      1. If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (c) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information. 
      2. [If a Borrower is a US Tax Obligor or the Agent reasonably believes that its obligations under FATCA or any other applicable law or regulation require it, each Lender shall, within [ten] Business Days of:

(B)        any withholding statement or other document, authorisation or waiver as the Agent may require to certify or establish the status of such Lender under FATCA or that other law or regulation.
      1. The Agent shall provide any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver it receives from a Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) above to the relevant Borrower.
      2. If any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver provided to the Agent by a Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) above is or becomes materially inaccurate or incomplete, that Lender shall promptly update it and provide such updated withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver to the Agent unless it is unlawful for the Lender to do so (in which case the Lender shall promptly notify the Agent). The Agent shall provide any such updated withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver to the relevant Borrower.
      3. The Agent may rely on any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver it receives from a Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) or (g) above without further verification. The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by it under or in connection with paragraph (e), (f) or (g) above.][72]
   1. FATCA Deduction
      1. Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.
      2. Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify the Parent and the Agent and the Agent shall notify the other Finance Parties.

         2. an additional or increased cost; or
         3. a reduction of any amount due and payable under any Finance Document,

SECTION 7
GUARANTEE
1. GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY
   1. Guarantee and indemnity
Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:
      1. guarantees to each Finance Party punctual performance by each other Obligor of all that Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;
      2. undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever another Obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and
      3. agrees with each Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify that Finance Party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due.  The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 24 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.
   1. Continuing guarantee
This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
   1. Reinstatement
If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause 24 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.
   1. Waiver of defences
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 24 will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause 24, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 24 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including:
      1. any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;
      2. the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;
      3. the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;
      4. any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;
      5. any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of a Finance Document or any other document or security including, without limitation, any change in the purpose of, any extension of or increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any Finance Document or other document or security;
      6. any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or
      7. any insolvency or similar proceedings.
   1. Guarantor intent
Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 24.4 (Waiver of defences), each Guarantor expressly confirms that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Finance Documents and/or any facility or amount made available under any of the Finance Documents for the purposes of or in connection with any of the following:  business acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities; refinancing any other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any other variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available from time to time; and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing.
   1. Immediate recourse
Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 24.  This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.
   1. Appropriations
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:
      1. refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
      2. hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this Clause 24.
   1. Deferral of Guarantors' rights
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 24:
      1. to be indemnified by an Obligor;
      2. to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;
      3. to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by any Finance Party;
      4. to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 24.1 (Guarantee and indemnity);
      5. to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or
      6. to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.
If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 36 (Payment mechanics).
   1. Release of Guarantors' right of contribution
If any Guarantor (a "Retiring Guarantor") ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Guarantor then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:
      1. that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and
      2. each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.
   1. Additional security
This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.
   1. Guarantee limitations[81]
[This guarantee does not apply to any liability to the extent that it would result in this guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of sections 678 or 679 of the Companies Act 2006 [or any equivalent and applicable provisions under the laws of the Original Jurisdiction of the relevant Guarantor] and, with respect to any Additional Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the Accession Deed applicable to such Additional Guarantor.]

         3. performance by the Agent of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to such assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Agent shall promptly notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender.
      1. A transfer will only be effective if the New Lender enters into the documentation required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement and if the procedure set out in Clause 30.6 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.
      2. If:
         1. a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and
         2. as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under Clause 20 (Increased Costs),
then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled to receive payment under that Clause to the same extent as the Existing Lender or Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.  This paragraph (e) shall not apply in respect of an assignment or transfer made in the ordinary course of the primary syndication of any Facility.
      1. Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in accordance with this Agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.
   1. Assignment or transfer fee
      1. Subject to paragraph (b) below, the New Lender shall, on the date upon which an assignment or transfer takes effect, pay to the Agent (for its own account) a fee of [          ].

         1. the Agent agrees that no fee is payable; or
         2. the assignment or transfer is made by an Existing Lender:
            1. to an Affiliate of that Existing Lender;
            2. to a fund which is a Related Fund of that Existing Lender; or
            3. in connection with primary syndication of any Facility.
   1. Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders
      1. Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for:
         1. the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the Transaction Documents, the Transaction Security or any other documents;
         2. the financial condition of any Obligor;
         3. the performance and observance by any Obligor [or any other member of the Group] of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or any other documents; or
         4. the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with any Transaction Document or any other document,
and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.
      1. Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender, the other Finance Parties and the Secured Parties that it:
         1. has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related entities in connection with its participation in this Agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender or any other Finance Party in connection with any Transaction Document or the Transaction Security; and
         2. will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.
      1. Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:
         1. accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and obligations assigned or transferred under this Clause 30; or
         2. support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or otherwise.
   1. Procedure for transfer
      1. Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 30.2 [(Parent consultation)]/[(Parent consent)] and Clause 30.3 (Other conditions of assignment or transfer) a transfer is effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below when the Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender.  The Agent shall, subject to paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a duly completed Transfer Certificate appearing on its face to comply with the terms of this Agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, execute that Transfer Certificate.
      2. The Agent shall only be obliged to execute a Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the transfer to such New Lender.

         1. to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to transfer by novation its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security each of the Obligors and the Existing Lender shall be released from further obligations towards one another under the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security and their respective rights against one another under the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security shall be cancelled (being the "Discharged Rights and Obligations");
         2. each of the Obligors and the New Lender shall assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor or other member of the Group and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;
         3. the Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the New Lender, the other Lenders, the Issuing Bank and any relevant Ancillary Lender shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves and in respect of the Transaction Security as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights, and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the Issuing Bank and any relevant Ancillary Lender and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and
         4. the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender".
   1. Procedure for assignment
      1. Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 30.2 [(Parent consultation)]/[(Parent consent)] and Clause 30.3 (Other conditions of assignment or transfer) an assignment may be effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below when the Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

      2. The Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the assignment to such New Lender.
      3. [Subject to Clause 30.11 (Pro rata interest settlement), on]/[On] the Transfer Date:
         1. the Existing Lender will assign absolutely to the New Lender its rights under the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security expressed to be the subject of the assignment in the Assignment Agreement;
         2. the Existing Lender will be released from the obligations (the "Relevant Obligations") expressed to be the subject of the release in the Assignment Agreement (and any corresponding obligations by which it is bound in respect of the Transaction Security); and
         3. the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender" and will be bound by obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.[118]
      1. Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this Clause 30.7 to assign their rights under the Finance Documents (but not, without the consent of the relevant Obligor or unless in accordance with Clause 30.6 (Procedure for transfer), to obtain a release by that Obligor from the obligations owed to that Obligor by the Lenders nor the assumption of equivalent obligations by a New Lender) provided that they comply with the conditions set out in Clause 30.2 [(Parent consultation)]/[(Parent consent)] and Clause 30.3 (Other conditions of assignment or transfer).
   1. Copy of Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation to Parent
The Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has executed a Transfer Certificate, an Assignment Agreement or an Increase Confirmation, send to the Parent a copy of that Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation.

Any person which becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Hedge Counterparty shall, at the same time, become a Party to this Agreement as a "Hedge Counterparty" in accordance with clause [22.11] (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
   1. [Security over Lenders' rights
In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this Clause 30, each Lender may without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or otherwise create Security in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under any Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including, without limitation:
      1. any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank; and
      2. any charge, assignment or other Security granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as security for those obligations or securities,
except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:
         1. release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or
         2. require any payments to be made by an Obligor other than or in excess of, or grant to any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Finance Documents.]
   1. [Pro rata interest settlement
      1. If the Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a "pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to Clause 30.6 (Procedure for transfer) or any assignment pursuant to Clause 30.7 (Procedure for assignment) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):
         1. any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date ("Accrued Amounts") and shall become due and payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the next of the dates which falls at six Monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period); and
         2. the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:
            1. when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and
            2. the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this Clause 30.11, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.
      1. In this Clause 30.11 references to "Interest Period" shall be construed to include a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.
      2. An Existing Lender which retains the right to the Accrued Amounts pursuant to this Clause 30.11 but which does not have a Commitment shall be deemed not to be a Lender for the purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of Lenders has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote of Lenders under the Finance Documents.]

         2. in its capacity as Lender, unless the Agent otherwise agrees, it shall not be entitled to receive any report or other document prepared at the behest of, or on the instructions of, the Agent or one or more of the Lenders. 
   1. Sponsor Affiliates' notification to other Lenders of Debt Purchase Transactions

      2. A Borrower may purchase by way of assignment, pursuant to Clause 30 (Changes to the Lenders), a participation in any Term Loan[120] in respect of which it is the borrower and any related Commitment where:

      1. In this Clause 32.3, Clause 32.5 (Resignation of a Guarantor) and Clause 32.7 (Resignation [and release of Security] on disposal), "Third Party Disposal" means the disposal of an Obligor to a person which is not a member of the Group where that disposal is permitted under Clause 28.17 (Disposals) or made with the approval of the Majority Lenders (and the Parent has confirmed this is the case).

[With the prior consent of all the Lenders, the Parent may request that a Borrower ceases to be a Borrower by delivering to the Agent a Resignation Letter]/[If a Borrower is the subject of a Third Party Disposal, the Parent may request that such Borrower (other than the Parent or the Company) ceases to be a Borrower by delivering to the Agent a Resignation Letter].

   1. Appointment of the Agent
      1. Each of the Arranger, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank appoints the Agent to act as its agent under and in connection with the Finance Documents.

      2. Save in the case of decisions stipulated to be a matter for any other Lender or group of Lenders under the relevant Finance Document and unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document, any instructions given to the Agent by the Majority Lenders shall override any conflicting instructions given by any other Parties and will be binding on all Finance Parties save for the Security Agent.
      3. The Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of any Lender or group of Lenders until it has received any indemnification and/or security that it may in its discretion require (which may be greater in extent than that contained in the Finance Documents and which may include payment in advance) for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions.
      4. In the absence of instructions, the Agent may act (or refrain from acting) as it considers to be in the best interest of the Lenders.

Except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents, the Arranger has no obligations of any kind to any other Party under or in connection with any Finance Document.

   1. Rights and discretions
      1. The Agent [and the Issuing Bank] may:
         1. rely on any representation, communication, notice or document (including, without limitation, any notice given by a Lender pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c) of Clause 31.2 (Disenfranchisement of Sponsor Affiliates)) believed by it to be genuine, correct and appropriately authorised;
         2. assume that:
            1. any instructions received by it from the Majority Lenders, any Lenders or any group of Lenders are duly given in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents; and
            2. unless it has received notice of revocation, that those instructions have not been revoked; and
         1. rely on a certificate from any person:
            1. as to any matter of fact or circumstance which might reasonably be expected to be within the knowledge of that person; or
            2. to the effect that such person approves of any particular dealing, transaction, step, action or thing,
as sufficient evidence that that is the case and, in the case of paragraph (A) above, may assume the truth and accuracy of that certificate.
      1. The Agent may assume (unless it has received notice to the contrary in its capacity as agent for the Lenders) that:

      2. Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (c) above or paragraph (e) below, the Agent may at any time engage and pay for the services of any lawyers to act as independent counsel to the Agent (and so separate from any lawyers instructed by the Lenders) if the Agent in its reasonable opinion deems this to be desirable.
      3. The Agent may rely on the advice or services of any lawyers, accountants, tax advisers, surveyors or other professional advisers or experts (whether obtained by the Agent or by any other Party) and shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses to any person, any diminution in value or any liability whatsoever arising as a result of its so relying.
      4. The Agent may act in relation to the Finance Documents through its officers, employees and agents and the Agent shall not:
         1. be liable for any error of judgment made by any such person; or
         2. be bound to supervise, or be in any way responsible for, any loss incurred by reason of misconduct, omission or default on the part of any such person,
unless such error or such loss was directly caused by the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
      1. Unless a Finance Document expressly provides otherwise the Agent may disclose to any other Party any information it reasonably believes it has received as agent under this Agreement.
      2. Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (g) above, the Agent:

      1. Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document to the contrary, none of the Agent, the Arranger or the Issuing Bank is obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would, or might in its reasonable opinion, constitute a breach of any law or regulation or a breach of a fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality.
      2. Notwithstanding any provision of any Finance Document to the contrary, the Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
   1. Responsibility for documentation
None of the Agent, the Arranger, the Issuing Bank [or any Ancillary Lender] is responsible or liable for:
      1. the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any information (whether oral or written) supplied by the Agent, the Arranger, the Issuing Bank, an Ancillary Lender, an Obligor or any other person in or in connection with any Finance Document or the Information Memorandum or the Reports or the transactions contemplated in the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document; [or]

      2. The Agent will not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required under the Finance Documents to be paid by the Agent if the Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by the Agent for that purpose.
      3. Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige the Agent or the Arranger to carry out:
         1. any "know your customer" or other checks in relation to any person; or
         2. any check on the extent to which any transaction contemplated by this Agreement might be unlawful for any Lender [or for any Affiliate of any Lender],
on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to the Agent and the Arranger that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Agent or the Arranger.
      1. Without prejudice to any provision of any Finance Document excluding or limiting the Agent's liability, any liability of the Agent arising under or in connection with any Finance Document or the Transaction Security shall be limited to the amount of actual loss which has been finally judicially determined to have been suffered (as determined by reference to the date of default of the Agent or, if later, the date on which the loss arises as a result of such default) but without reference to any special conditions or circumstances known to the Agent at any time which increase the amount of that loss.  In no event shall the Agent be liable for any loss of profits, goodwill, reputation, business opportunity or anticipated saving, or for special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, whether or not the Agent has been advised of the possibility of such loss or damages.
   1. Lenders' indemnity to the Agent
      1. Each Lender shall (in proportion to its share of the Total Commitments or, if the Total Commitments are then zero, to its share of the Total Commitments immediately prior to their reduction to zero) indemnify the Agent, within three Business Days of demand, against any cost, loss or liability [(including, without limitation, for negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever)][128] incurred by the Agent (otherwise than by reason of the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct) [(or, in the case of any cost, loss or liability pursuant to Clause 36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.), notwithstanding the Agent's negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever but not including any claim based on the fraud of the Agent)][129] in acting as Agent under the Finance Documents (unless the Agent has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to a Finance Document).
      2. Subject to paragraph ‎(c) below, the Parent shall immediately on demand reimburse any Lender for any payment that Lender makes to the Agent pursuant to paragraph ‎(a) above.
      3. Paragraph ‎(b) above shall not apply to the extent that the indemnity payment in respect of which the Lender claims reimbursement relates to a liability of the Agent to an Obligor.

      1. The Agent may resign and appoint one of its Affiliates acting through an office [in the United Kingdom] as successor by giving notice to the Lenders and the Parent.
      2. Alternatively the Agent may resign by giving 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the Parent, in which case the Majority Lenders (after consultation with the Parent) may appoint a successor Agent.
      3. If the Majority Lenders have not appointed a successor Agent in accordance with paragraph (b) above within 20 days after notice of resignation was given, the retiring Agent (after consultation with the Parent) may appoint a successor Agent [(acting through an office in the United Kingdom)].
      4. If the Agent wishes to resign because (acting reasonably) it has concluded that it is no longer appropriate for it to remain as agent and the Agent is entitled to appoint a successor Agent under paragraph (c) above, the Agent may (if it concludes (acting reasonably) that it is necessary to do so in order to persuade the proposed successor Agent to become a party to this Agreement as Agent) agree with the proposed successor Agent amendments to this Clause 33 [and any other term of this Agreement dealing with the rights or obligations of the Agent] consistent with then current market practice for the appointment and protection of corporate trustees together with any reasonable amendments to the agency fee payable under this Agreement which are consistent with the successor Agent's normal fee rates and those amendments will bind the Parties.
      5. The retiring Agent shall, [at its own cost,] make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents. [The Parent shall, within three Business Days of demand, reimburse the retiring Agent for the amount of all costs and expenses (including legal fees) properly incurred by it in making available such documents and records and providing such assistance.]
      6. The Agent's resignation notice shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor.
      7.

Any successor and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been an original Party.
      8. The Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above (and, to the extent applicable, shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint a successor Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) above) if on or after the date which is [three] months before the earliest FATCA Application Date relating to any payment to the Agent under the Finance Documents, either:
         1. the Agent fails to respond to a request under Clause 19.8 (FATCA information) and [the Parent or] a Lender reasonably believes that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;
         2. the information supplied by the Agent pursuant to Clause 19.8 (FATCA information) indicates that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date; or
         3. the Agent notifies the Parent and the Lenders that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;
and (in each case) [the Parent or] a Lender reasonably believes that a Party will be required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the Agent were a FATCA Exempt Party, and [the Parent or] that Lender, by notice to the Agent, requires it to resign.
   1. Replacement of the Agent
      1. After consultation with the Parent, the Majority Lenders may, by giving 30 days' notice to the Agent (or, at any time the Agent is an Impaired Agent, by giving any shorter notice determined by the Majority Lenders) replace the Agent by appointing a successor Agent [(acting through an office in the United Kingdom)].
      2. The retiring Agent shall (at its own cost if it is an Impaired Agent and otherwise at the expense of the Lenders) make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents.
      3. The appointment of the successor Agent shall take effect on the date specified in the notice from the Majority Lenders to the retiring Agent. As from this date, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents (other than its obligations under paragraph (b) above) but shall remain entitled to the benefit of Clause 21.3 (Indemnity to the Agent) and this Clause 33 (and any agency fees for the account of the retiring Agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall be payable on) that date).
      4. Any successor Agent and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been an original Party.

         2. entitled to receive and act upon any notice, request, document or communication or make any decision or determination under any Finance Document made or delivered on that day,

         2. the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the receipt or recovery been received or made by the Agent and distributed in accordance with Clause 36 (Payment mechanics), without taking account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and
         3. the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent an amount (the "Sharing Payment") equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause 36.6 (Partial payments).

      1. each Sharing Finance Party shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to the appropriate part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Finance Party for its proportion of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Finance Party is required to pay) (the "Redistributed Amount"); and
      2. as between the relevant Obligor and each relevant Sharing Finance Party, an amount equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

      2. A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any amount which the Recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if:
         1. it notified the other Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and
         2. the other Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal or arbitration proceedings but did not do so as soon as reasonably practicable having received notice and did not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.

SECTION 11
ADMINISTRATION
1. PAYMENT MECHANICS
   1. Payments to the Agent
      1. On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under a Finance Document, excluding a payment under the terms of an Ancillary Document, that Obligor or Lender shall make the same available to the Agent (unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds specified by the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.
      2. Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in such Participating Member State or London, as specified by the Agent) and with such bank as the Agent, in each case, specifies.
   1. Distributions by the Agent
Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject to Clause 36.3 (Distributions to an Obligor) and Clause 36.4 (Clawback and pre-funding) be made available by the Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Agent by not less than five Business Days' notice with a bank specified by that Party in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal financial centre of a Participating Member State or London, as specified by that Party).
   1. Distributions to an Obligor
The Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with Clause 37 (Set-Off)) apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.
   1. Clawback and pre-funding
      1. Where a sum is to be paid to the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party, the Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.
      2. Unless paragraph (c) below applies, if the Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the case that the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the Agent shall on demand refund the same to the Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by the Agent, calculated by the Agent to reflect its cost of funds.
      3. If the Agent [has notified the Lenders that it] is willing to make available amounts for the account of a Borrower before receiving funds from the Lenders then if and to the extent that the Agent does so but it proves to be the case that it does not then receive funds from a Lender in respect of a sum which it paid to a Borrower:
         1. [the Agent shall notify the Parent of that Lender's identity and] the Borrower to whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to the Agent; and
         2. the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that Lender fails to do so, the Borrower to whom that sum was made available, shall on demand pay to the Agent the amount (as certified by the Agent) which will indemnify the Agent against any funding cost incurred by it as a result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds from that Lender.
   1. Impaired Agent
      1. If, at any time, the Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Lender which is required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Agent in accordance with Clause 36.1 (Payments to the Agent) may instead either:
         1. pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s); or 
         2. if in its absolute discretion it considers that it is not reasonably practicable to pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s), pay that amount or the relevant part of that amount to an interest-bearing account held with an Acceptable Bank within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of "Acceptable Bank" and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making the payment (the "Paying Party") and designated as a trust account for the benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the Finance Documents (the "Recipient Party" or "Recipient Parties").
In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the Finance Documents.
      1. All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall be for the benefit of the Recipient Party or the Recipient Parties pro rata to their respective entitlements.
      2. A Party which has made a payment in accordance with this Clause 36.5 shall be discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents and shall not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the credit of the trust account.
      3. Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with Clause 33.13 (Replacement of the Agent), each Paying Party shall (other than to the extent that that Party has given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (e) below) give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Agent for distribution to the relevant Recipient Party or Recipient Parties in accordance with Clause 36.2 (Distributions by the Agent).
      4. A Paying Party shall, promptly upon request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:
         1. that it has not given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (d) above; and
         2. that it has been provided with the necessary information by that Recipient Party,
give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the relevant amount (together with any accrued interest) to that Recipient Party.
   1. Partial payments
      1. If the Agent receives a payment for application against amounts due in respect of any Finance Documents that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by an Obligor under those Finance Documents, the Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of that Obligor under the Finance Documents in the following order:
         1. first, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid amount owing to the Agent, the Issuing Bank (other than any amount under Clause 7.2 (Claims under a Letter of Credit) or, to the extent relating to the reimbursement of a claim (as defined in Clause 7 (Letters of Credit)), Clause 7.3 (Indemnities)) or the Security Agent under the Finance Documents;
         2. secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fee or commission due but unpaid under those Finance Documents;
         3. thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due but unpaid under those Finance Documents and any amount due but unpaid under Clause 7.2 (Claims under a Letter of Credit) and Clause 7.3 (Indemnities); and
         4. fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but unpaid under the Finance Documents.

      4. Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes shall be made in the currency in which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred.
      5. Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than the Base Currency shall be paid in that other currency.

         1. any reference in the Finance Documents to, and any obligations arising under the Finance Documents in, the currency of that country shall be translated into, or paid in, the currency or currency unit of that country designated by the Agent (after consultation with the Parent); and
         2. any translation from one currency or currency unit to another shall be at the official rate of exchange recognised by the central bank for the conversion of that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down by the Agent (acting reasonably).
      1. If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this Agreement will, to the extent the Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Parent) specifies to be necessary, be amended to comply with any generally accepted conventions and market practice in the Relevant Market and otherwise to reflect the change in currency.

If the obligations are in different currencies, the Finance Party may convert either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off.
      2.

         1. the Parent or the Agent (at the request of the Parent) has requested the Lenders to give a consent in relation to, or to agree to a waiver or amendment of, any provisions of the Finance Documents;
         2. the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the approval of all the Lenders [or the Super Majority Lenders]; and
         3. Lenders whose Commitments aggregate [either:]
            1. [in the case of a consent, waiver or amendment requiring the approval of all the Lenders,] more than [  ] per cent. of the Total Commitments (or, if the Total Commitments have been reduced to zero, aggregated more than [  ] per cent. of the Total Commitments prior to that reduction)[; or
            2. in the case of a consent, waiver or amendment requiring the approval of the Super Majority Lenders, more than [  ] per cent. of the Total Commitments (or, if the Total Commitments have been reduced to zero, aggregated more than [  ] per cent. of the Total Commitments prior to that reduction)],

            2. the agreement of any specified group of Lenders,
has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote of Lenders under the Finance Documents, 
that Defaulting Lender's Commitments under the relevant Facility/ies will be reduced by the amount of its Available Commitments under the relevant Facility/ies and, to the extent that that reduction results in that Defaulting Lender's Total Commitments being zero, that Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender for the purposes of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.

to an Eligible Institution (a "Replacement Lender") which is acceptable (in the case of any transfer of a Revolving Facility Commitment) to the Issuing Bank and which confirms its willingness to assume and does assume all the obligations, or all the relevant obligations, of the transferring Lender in accordance with Clause 30 (Changes to the Lenders) [for a purchase price in cash payable at the time of transfer which is either:
         1. in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender's participation in the outstanding Utilisations and all accrued interest and/or Letter of Credit fees [(to the extent that the Agent has not given a notification under Clause 30.11 (Pro rata interest settlement))], Break Costs and other amounts payable in relation thereto under the Finance Documents; or
         2. in an amount agreed between that Defaulting Lender, the Replacement Lender and the Parent and which does not exceed the amount described in paragraph (i) above.]

1. GOVERNING LAW
This Agreement [and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it][151] [is/are] governed by English law.
1. ENFORCEMENT
   1. Jurisdiction of English courts[152]
      1. The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including a dispute relating to the existence, validity or termination of this Agreement [or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement][153]) (a "Dispute").
      2. The Parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate and convenient courts to settle Disputes and accordingly no Party will argue to the contrary.
      3. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, no Finance Party or Secured Party shall be prevented from taking proceedings relating to a Dispute in any other courts with jurisdiction.  To the extent allowed by law, the Finance Parties and Secured Parties may take concurrent proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

      1. Without prejudice to any other mode of service allowed under any relevant law, each Obligor (other than an Obligor incorporated in England and Wales):
         1. irrevocably appoints [the Parent]/[insert name of other Original Obligor which is appointed as agent] as its agent for service of process in relation to any proceedings before the English courts in connection with any Finance Document [(and the [Parent]/[insert name of other Original Obligor which is appointed as agent] by its execution of this Agreement, accepts that appointment)]; and
         2. agrees that failure by an agent for service of process to notify the relevant Obligor of the process will not invalidate the proceedings concerned.
      1. If any person appointed as an agent for service of process is unable for any reason to act as agent for service of process, the Parent (on behalf of all the Obligors) must immediately (and in any event within [   ] days of such event taking place) appoint another agent on terms acceptable to the Agent.  Failing this, the Agent may appoint another agent for this purpose.
This Agreement has been entered into on the date stated at the beginning of this Agreement.

Agreed Security Principles
                                                            1. Considerations
In determining what Security will be provided in support of the Facilities (and any related hedging arrangements in respect of the types of liabilities and/or risks which the Hedging Letter requires to be hedged) the following matters will be taken into account.  Security shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it would:
                                                            1. result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference or thin capitalisation laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction;
                                                            2. result in a significant risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of Security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal liability; or
                                                            3. result in costs that, in the opinion of the Agent, are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that Security.
For the avoidance of doubt, in these Agreed Security Principles, "cost" includes, but is not limited to, income tax cost, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for the continuance of any Security, stamp duties, out-of-pocket expenses, and other fees and expenses directly incurred by the relevant grantor of Security or any of its direct or indirect owners, subsidiaries or Affiliates.
                                                            1. Obligations to be Secured
                                                            1. Subject to (A) (Considerations) and to paragraph 2 below, the obligations to be secured are the Secured Obligations (as defined below).  The Security is to be granted in favour of the Security Agent on behalf of each Lender from time to time, and the Agent, the Arranger, the Issuing Bank, any Hedge Counterparty and the agent, the arranger(s) and the lenders under the Mezzanine Facility Agreement.
For ease of reference, the following definitions should, to the extent legally possible, be incorporated into each Transaction Security Document (with the capitalised terms used in them having the meaning given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement):
"Secured Obligations" means all the Liabilities and all other present and future liabilities and obligations at any time due, owing or incurred by any member of the Group and by each Debtor to any Secured Party under the Debt Documents, both actual and contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly and as principal or surety or in any other capacity.[186]
"Secured Parties" means the Security Agent, any Receiver or Delegate and each of the Primary Creditors from time to time but, in the case of each Primary Creditor, only if it is a party to the Intercreditor Agreement or has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement, in the appropriate capacity, pursuant to clause [22.11] (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement.[187]
                                                            1. The secured obligations will be limited:
                                                            1. to avoid any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules or the laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; and
                                                            2. to avoid any risk to officers of the relevant member of the Group that is granting Transaction Security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or civil or criminal or personal liability.
                                                            1. General
Where appropriate, defined terms in the Transaction Security Documents should mirror those in this Agreement.
The parties to this Agreement agree to negotiate the form of each Transaction Security Document in good faith and will ensure that all documentation required to be entered into as a condition precedent to first drawdown under this Agreement (or immediately thereafter) is in a finally agreed form as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.  The form of guarantee is set out in Clause 24 (Guarantee and Indemnity) of this Agreement and, with respect to any Additional Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the Accession Deed applicable to such Additional Guarantor.
The Security shall, to the extent possible under local law, be enforceable on the occurrence of [an Event of Default] / [an Event of Default in respect of which the Agent has exercised any of its rights under Clause 29.20 (Acceleration) (or the agent under the Mezzanine Facility Agreement has exercised any of its rights under clause [  ] of the Mezzanine Facility Agreement)].
                                                            1. Undertakings/Representations and Warranties
Any representations, warranties or undertakings which are required to be included in any Transaction Security Document shall reflect (to the extent to which the subject matter of such representation, warranty and undertaking is the same as the corresponding representation, warranty and undertaking in this Agreement) the commercial deal set out in this Agreement (save to the extent that Secured Parties' local counsel deem it necessary to include any further provisions (or deviate from those contained in this Agreement) in order to protect or preserve the Security granted to the Secured Parties).
                                                            1. [          ]

                                                               1. The Facility Office and address, fax number and attention details for notices to the Increase Lender for the purposes of Clause 38.2 (Addresses) of the Facilities Agreement are set out in the Schedule.

________________
[1]         Delete if no Hedge Counterparties are party to this Agreement at signing.
[2]         The Agreement assumes that various amounts are held in accounts with the Agent (e.g. a Holding Account).  If the Agent is not able to maintain such accounts amendments will be needed.
[3]         The Agreement does not contain provisions for appointment of the Security Agent or other trust provisions.  It is assumed these are contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.  (The LMA recommended form of Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains such trust provisions).  Note that if security is granted over assets subject to non-English law a trustee arrangement may not be appropriate.
[4]         Users should note that if the Facilities Agreement is amended to envisage a Term Facility with a nominal amortisation (and the potential to establish an Incremental Facility with a similar amortisation structure is envisaged) this definition should be amended and Clause 11 (Repayment), Clause 12 (Illegality, voluntary prepayment and cancellation), and Clause 13 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation) (and related provisions) adapted to address the appropriate treatment of such Incremental Facilities.
[5]         This definition should be tailored to the commercial requirements on a transaction specific basis.
[6]         If using Historic Screen Rates as a fallback option users should consider the length of this period in the context of (a) the maturities for which the applicable Screen Rates are quoted and (b) the period of time for which the use of a Historic Screen Rate is considered appropriate.
[7]         Delete if no Hedge Counterparties are Party to this Agreement at signing.
[8]         This Agreement assumes that the Hedging Letter is prepared using the recommended form of LMA Hedging Letter for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine).  Users should consider the extent to which the hedging strategy documented in the Hedging Letter should (or should not) require hedging of interest rate and/or exchange rate risks in relation to any Incremental Facility.
[9]         Users should consider the extent to which such a separate condition precedent independent of paragraph (a)(iv) of Clause 10.6 (Conditions to establishment) should automatically apply to every Incremental Facility for the benefit of the relevant Incremental Facility Lenders or whether the extent to which such a separate condition precedent is required should be agreed by the relevant Incremental Facility Lenders and the Parent in the relevant Incremental Facility Notice.
[10]         Users should note that the Banking Act 2009 allows for the effectiveness of this limb to be disapplied in certain circumstances and that it is possible that, in some contexts, regulators may constrain borrowers from agreeing to its inclusion.
[11]         Insert if paragraph (f) is not included.
[12]         Insert if paragraph (f) is included.
[13]         This definition (other than paragraph (f) and the carve-out to paragraph (h)) is based on the Bankruptcy event of default definition contained in ISDA Master Agreement documentation.
[14]         Delete if no Hedge Counterparties will be party to the Intercreditor Agreement at signing.
[15]         This Agreement assumes that the Intercreditor Agreement is prepared using the recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine).
[16]         If specifying the rounding convention users may wish to consider altering this suggested convention to that used in any corresponding hedging product.
[17]         Users should note that ICE LIBOR (formerly known as BBA LIBOR) is produced for a limited range of tenors and currencies.  See the Intercontinental Exchange Group website for more information.
[18]         Events (such as the occurrence of material adverse change) under the Acquisition Agreement which may prevent Completion occurring may be included here.
[19]         See the LMA Memorandum on "Auditor choice provisions in LMA facility documentation" which is available through the LMA website for further information.
[20]         Insert details of any currency that is, or may be, available under the Agreement for which the interest rate is not intended to be determined by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR.  The details in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks) must be completed for each Non-LIBOR Currency.
[21]         Option 1 as described in footnote 23 below.
[22]         Option 2 as described in footnote 23 below.
[23]         Provisions allowing Lenders to control an entity's choice of auditor are prohibited under EU legislation.  Two alternative formulations are provided.  The first is intended for use where the EU legislation is applicable to the Parent. It does not seek to control the Parent's choice of auditor.  The second is intended for use where the EU legislation is not applicable to the Parent.  It allows Lenders to control the Parent's choice of auditor.  Users will need to consider the options carefully (and see the LMA Memorandum on "Auditor choice provisions in LMA facility documentation" which is available through the LMA website for further information).  If the EU legislation is applicable to the Parent but is not applicable to one or more significant members of the Group it may be appropriate to amend these provisions to allow Lenders to control those Group members' choice of auditor.
[24]         NB If there are assets subject to fixed charges under any Transaction Security Document consider excluding them from these paragraphs due to risk of fixed charges being characterised as floating charges.
[25]         To the extent that there are to be further restrictions on payments of dividends on the Preference Shares these should be set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
[26]         To the extent that there are to be further restrictions on payments of these dividends these should be set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
[27]         NB If there are assets subject to fixed charges under any Transaction Security Document consider excluding them from these paragraphs due to risk of fixed charges being characterised as floating charges.
[28]         Insert if the interest rate for euro is determined by reference to EURIBOR.
[29]         The potential for subsequent intra-day correction, recalculation or republication of an originally published Screen Rate can raise difficult issues that should be considered carefully to ensure that the parties achieve the desired commercial outcome.  Users should carefully consider the extent to which excluding the effects of any such correction, recalculation or republication is suitable for the transaction in question.  See the LMA note entitled "ICE LIBOR and EURIBOR refixing policies and LMA facility documentation" (available through the LMA website).
[30]         This definition is intended to have the effect of referencing (i) the LIBOR rate which is currently known as ICE LIBOR and (ii) the euro interbank offered rate which is currently known as Euribor, irrespective of any change of administrator or publisher occurring after the date of the Agreement.  It may not be suitable if this effect does not represent the commercial agreement.  Users should note that changes to this definition may have implications under associated interest rate hedging arrangements.
[31]         The proviso is aimed at excluding CDOs of sponsors which are run independently to their private equity business. 
[32]         Insert if the Super Majority concept is used in Clause 42.6 (Structural Adjustment)
[33]         Note that some Lenders take the view that once an Event of Default has occurred it should be continuing unless the Lenders have waived it in accordance with Clause 42 (Amendments and Waivers).
[34]         Users should consider carefully the appropriate currency definition(s) in the context of the transaction and should consider defining any other currency referred to in the Agreement.
[35]         Insert agreed time period.
[36]         The Transaction Security and guarantees provided under this Agreement may not in all jurisdictions continue to secure or guarantee the increased Commitment or be for the benefit of the Increase Lender.  It is the responsibility of the Increase Lender to ascertain whether any other documents or other formalities are required to confirm the Transaction Security/guarantees in any jurisdiction and/or for it to benefit from such Transaction Security and/or guarantees and, if so, to arrange for execution of those documents and completion of those formalities.
[37]         The funding of acquisitions may fall within the scope of general corporate purposes depending on the company's objects (which may be restricted by its Constitutional Documents) and, therefore, should be expressly excluded if the Revolving Facility is not intended to be used to fund acquisitions.
[38]         When specifying a pre-approved Optional Currency users should consider the extent to which that currency should be listed as a Non-LIBOR Currency and the agreed Screen Rate (and related terms) included in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks).
        If the Clause is amended to allow for subsequent approval of Optional Currencies with less than all Lender consent, users should consider providing for a mechanic to agree a suitable Screen Rate (and related terms) at the same time.
[39]         Consider in light of Triodos Bank NV v. Ashley Charles Dobbs.
[40]         Lenders may wish to consider any credit risk connected with depositing an amount in an account with the Issuing Bank.
[41]         Users should ensure that the time period given for a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender to provide cash collateral under paragraph (a) and the amount of notice to be given by a Borrower when requesting the issue of a Letter of Credit are such that if a Lender is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender at the time the Issuing Bank is informed of a proposed Letter of Credit: (i) the Non-Acceptable L/C Lender will be obliged to provide cash collateral prior to the relevant Utilisation Date; and (ii) the Borrower will have time in which to elect to provide cash cover itself if necessary.
[42]         Users should be aware that giving Obligors rights of withdrawal involves a risk that any fixed security interest might be recharacterised as a floating security interest.
[43]         For use where provisions are included to facilitate Ancillary Lenders reporting Ancillary Facilities comprising group overdraft facilities "net" to the UK regulator.  Use the first option if the commercial agreement is that such Ancillary Lenders are permitted to demand repayment only within prescribed limits.  Use the second option if the commercial agreement is that Ancillary Lenders are not subject to such limits.  Users should note that the option chosen is likely to affect the extent to which such Ancillary Lenders are able to report group overdraft facilities on a "net" basis.  It is assumed that users will obtain regulatory advice in relation to the ability to report such facilities "net".
[44]         Loss sharing may not be appropriate in all circumstances. Where it is considered to be appropriate it may be necessary to discuss whether sharing arrangements between the Lenders and Ancillary Lenders in relation to remuneration are also appropriate.
[45]         Two (alternative) forms of Clause 10.1 are provided.  The first option (entitled "Selection of Incremental Facility Lenders") requires that existing Lenders are given the right of first refusal to participate on a pro rata basis in any proposed Incremental Facility.  The second option (entitled "Incremental Facility Lenders") allows the Parent to select any entity to participate in a proposed Incremental Facility provided that such entity is, optionally, not a Sponsor Affiliate or a member of the Group.  The two forms of Clause 10.1 are mutually exclusive.  Accordingly, it is NOT recommended that users include both forms in the same Agreement.  The Agreement envisages that one of the two alternative forms of Clause 10.1 is included in the Agreement.
[46]         Include if the first form of Clause 10.1 (entitled "Selection of Incremental Facility Lenders") is used.  
[47]         Include if the first form of Clause 10.1 (entitled "Selection of Incremental Facility Lenders") is used. 
[48]         Include if the first form of Clause 10.1 (entitled "Selection of Incremental Facility Lenders") is used.
[49]         Include if the second form of Clause 10.1 (entitled "Incremental Facility Lenders") is used.
[50]         Users should note that restrictions on the terms of Incremental Facilities should be considered on a transaction specific basis.  Users should consider which, if any, of the optional restrictions for which drafting is provided in Clause 10.5 (Restrictions on Incremental Facility Terms and fees) are appropriate in the context of the transaction.
[51]         Users should note that changes will be required to this Agreement and the LMA Intercreditor Agreement (Senior/Mezzanine) if an Incremental Facility is capable of being denominated in any currency other than the Base Currency.
[52]         This Agreement restricts the quantum of the Incremental Facilities by reference to a fixed numerical limit.  Users should note that the extent to which this is appropriate should be considered on a transaction specific basis.
[53]         Users should note that the inclusion of this automatic termout mechanic in respect of a Defaulting Lender's participation in Revolving Facility Loans may have the result that the Revolving Facility is not always drawn on a pro rata basis and that, accordingly, a Defaulting Lender whose participation in Revolving Facility Loans is termed out in this way may suffer a disproportionate loss if the Borrower defaults when the only Loans outstanding under the Revolving Facility are Separate Loans.
[54]         Users should note that it may not be necessary to address the effect of cancellations of Commitments on Repayment Instalments where those Repayment Instalments are expressed as a percentage of outstandings.
[55]         There may be a different treatment for voluntary and mandatory prepayments in which case this paragraph may need to be split in two.
[56]         This period needs to be an appropriate period in the context of the notice period for voluntary prepayments.
[57]         This Agreement envisages the use of one Screen Rate only per currency.  Users should consider the extent to which available Interest Periods should be restricted to tenors for which Screen Rates are available or can be interpolated from those Screen Rates.
[58]         Clause 17.1 (Unavailability of Screen Rate) provides for a waterfall of fallbacks if a Screen Rate is unavailable.  Two (alternative) forms of Clause 17.1 (Unavailability of Screen Rate) are provided.  The first form should be used if the commercial agreement is that Historic Screen Rates are to be used as an intermediate fallback before the use of reference banks or cost of funds.  The second form should be used if the commercial agreement is that Historic Screen Rates are not to be used as such an intermediate fallback.
[59]         The timings in this Clause are suggestions only and may need adjustment to accord with the Agent's and Reference Banks' operational requirements. 
[60]         Users should consider whether the Parent's rights under Clause 12.6 (Right of cancellation and repayment in relation to a single Lender or Issuing Bank) and Clause 42.8 (Replacement of Lender) should be extended to apply to a Lender making a notification to the Agent under Clause 17.3 (Market disruption).
[61]         Users should consider whether Clause 17.4 (Cost of funds) should be amended to allow the relevant Borrower to revoke the Utilisation Request relating to a Loan which falls to be priced on a cost of funds basis.
[62]         Include if cost of funds is not calculated on a weighted average basis.
[63]         Include if cost of funds is not calculated on a weighted average basis.
[64]         Include if cost of funds is calculated on a weighted average basis.
[65]         NB:  This does not include commitment fee on any Revolving Facility Commitment blocked for use as an Ancillary Facility.  Commitment fees on Ancillary Facilities are to be dealt with in Ancillary Documents.
[66]         This clause is drafted on the assumption that payments made by the Obligor(s) may be subject to withholding tax (if any) under United Kingdom law and not under the law of any other jurisdiction.  If this is not the case and the Obligor(s) is/are to gross-up payments, this Clause will need to be modified, in particular paragraphs (d), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (l) of Clause 19.2 (Tax Gross-up) and the related definitions.  If the "Treaty Lender" concept is used, always check the wording of relevant Treaties.
        This clause, and in particular the definition of "Qualifying Lender", should always be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Consideration should also be given as to whether the representation in Clause 25.10 (Deduction of Tax) requires amendment.
[67]         Users should consider expanding this definition if inclusion of pension funds among the lending syndicate is envisaged.  Users should refer to the tax-gross up provisions in the recommended form of LMA Term Facility Agreement for use in Pan-European Private Placements for suitable language.  Amendments will need to be made to: (a) the definitions of "Qualifying Lender" and "Tax Confirmation"; (b) paragraphs (d)(ii) and (d)(iii) of Clause 19.2 (Tax gross-up); (c) paragraph (a)(ii) of Clause 25.10 (Deduction of Tax); and (d) the forms of Tax Confirmation set out in Schedule 5 (Form of Transfer Certificate), Schedule 6 (Form of Assignment Agreement), Schedule 15 (Form of Increase Confirmation) and Schedule 19 (Form of Incremental Facility Lender Certificate).
[68]         This is a complex area and in each case relevant treaties should be reviewed and, if appropriate, additional wording inserted to apportion risk as agreed by the Parties.
[69]         If UK Non-Bank Lenders are to be envisaged and this definition is, therefore, included but no Original Lender is a UK Non-Bank Lender:
                                                                                 * delete this paragraph (i);
                                                                                 * delete Part III of Schedule 1 (The Original Parties); and
                                                                                 * delete the words "other than UK Non-Bank Lenders" from the heading of Part II of Schedule 1 (The Original Parties).
        Do not, however, delete this definition, as a UK Non-Bank Lender may become a Lender after the date of this Agreement.
[70]         This provision does not operate in an international context, so where there is an international context, this wording should be reviewed and updated accordingly. 
[71]         This provision does not operate for the benefit of non-Finance Parties and whether this is correct should be considered on a case by case basis. 
[72]         Paragraphs (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Clause 19.8 (FATCA information) may be used for loans entered into with US borrowers (or loans where a US borrower may become an Additional Borrower).  
[73]        The form of increased costs clause in this Agreement is drafted in deliberately wide terms in an attempt to cover all circumstances which could increase a Lender's costs as a result of a change in law or regulation.  The European legislation (often referred to as "CRD IV") which implements the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposed new standards for bank capital and liquidity requirements (labelled "Basel III") has come into force and potentially involves greater costs than those envisaged by Basel III.  Users may wish to consider whether to supplement the clause to address expressly the extent to which both Basel III costs and CRD IV costs are intended to be within, or outside, the scope of the clause.
[74]        Basel II was finalised in 2004 and implemented in Europe during 2007 and so it may not be necessary to include a Basel II carve out from the increased costs clause where the syndicate consists of European Lenders. If it is agreed by the parties to exclude Basel II from the increased costs clause, and for example this may be relevant where there are US Lenders in the syndicate as Basel II has not been fully implemented in the US, then users should note that elements of the Basel III papers amend the Basel II paper and so care needs to be taken with the drafting of the carve out. The following provision may be inserted at the end of this paragraph (a) of Clause 20.3 (Exceptions) to address this point:
        "(v)        attributable to the implementation or application of or compliance with the "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, a Revised Framework" published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2004 in the form existing on the date of this Agreement (but excluding any amendment arising out of Basel III) ("Basel II") or any other law or regulation which implements Basel II (whether such implementation, application or compliance is by a government, regulator, Finance Party or any of its Affiliates)." 
                The following definition should be added to paragraph (b) of Clause 20.1 (Increased costs):
                ""Basel III" means:
        (A)        the agreements on capital requirements, a leverage ratio and liquidity standards contained in "Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems", "Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring" and "Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer" published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010, each as amended, supplemented or restated;
        (B)        the rules for global systemically important banks contained in "Global systemically important banks: assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement – Rules text" published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in November 2011, as amended, supplemented or restated; and
        (C)        any further guidance or standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision relating to "Basel III"."
        Users should note that this definition of Basel III is deliberately wide and includes future Basel III publications.  It is, therefore, unlikely to be suitable to describe Basel III in the context of excluding Basel III costs from the scope of the increased costs clause generally.
[75]         Users should consider including this wording if the optional Clause 36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
[76]         Include words in brackets if optional Clause 36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
[77]         To the extent that an equivalent indemnity is included in the Intercreditor Agreement the indemnity in this Clause 21.4 (Indemnity to the Security Agent) can be removed to avoid unnecessary overlap.  (The recommended forms of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains an equivalent indemnity at clause 24.1 (Indemnity to the Security Agent)).
[78]         To the extent that an equivalent indemnity to the Security Agent is included in the Intercreditor Agreement the Security Agent can be removed from the coverage of the indemnity in Clause 23.1 (Transaction expenses) to avoid unnecessary overlap.  (The recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains an equivalent indemnity to the Security Agent at clause 23.1 (Transaction expenses)).
[79]         To the extent that an equivalent provision is included in the Intercreditor Agreement this provision can be removed to avoid unnecessary overlap. (The recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains an equivalent provision at clause 21.17 (Security Agent's management time and additional remuneration)).
[80]         To the extent that an equivalent indemnity to the Security Agent is included in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent can be removed from the coverage of the indemnity in Clause 23.4 (Enforcement and preservation costs) to avoid unnecessary overlap.  (The recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains an equivalent indemnity to the Security Agent at clause 23.3 (Enforcement and preservation costs).)
[81]         To the extent that any limitations are to apply to this guarantee, consideration should be given to whether those limitations should be extended to all indemnities and other assurances against loss in the Finance Documents, Hedging Agreements and the Mezzanine Finance Documents.
[82]         Lenders may wish to consider amendments, as appropriate, to reflect sanctions laws and regulations that may affect them depending on their jurisdiction of incorporation or business, for example US and EU sanctions (which may prohibit lenders from advancing funds to be made available to targets of any relevant sanctions authority, as well as other restrictions).  In addition, lenders in some jurisdictions should take advice in relation to possible conflict of laws that may impact on their ability to include clauses of this nature.  For further information see LMA Guidance Note: United States and European Union Sanctions (available through the LMA website). 
        If any clauses of this nature are included, users should note that some Lenders may have particular sensitivities to the amendment or waiver of any such clause.  Users should consider the extent to which Clause 42.3 (All Lender matters) should be supplemented to require all Lender consent for such amendment or waiver.
[83]         This representation should be considered on a case-by-case basis and modified or deleted as appropriate.  If tax other than UK tax may be relevant, this should be taken into account.
[84]         Include if paragraph (i)(B) of the definition of Qualifying Lender is included in Clause 19.1 (Definitions).
[85]         Include if paragraph (ii) of the definition of Qualifying Lender is included in Clause 19.1 (Definitions).
[86]         This representation should only be included if there are not and never have been any defined benefit occupational pension schemes (i.e. final salary pension schemes) within the Group (other than to the extent disclosed) and the Lenders want this position confirmed by the Obligors at the outset.  This representation does not need to be repeated if the undertaking contained in paragraph (b) of Clause 28.27 (Pensions) is included because the undertaking provides the ongoing obligation on the Group not to have such pension schemes.  
        This representation has been included to take account of the Pensions Act 2004, which effectively makes all members of the Group responsible for the deficits in any defined benefit occupational pension schemes which are operated by any member of the Group.
[87]        See the footnote to the definition of "Parent's Auditors".
[88]         With regard to Original Obligors, it is assumed that "know your customer" identification procedures will be complied with prior to execution of this Agreement.
[89]         Consider whether other types of shares/investments which might be classified as debt under the Accounting Principles should be included.
[90]         NB:  See paragraph (f) of "EBITDA".  If paragraph (f) of "EBITDA" is not included this may need to be amended.
[91]         See paragraph (b) of "Excess Cashflow".  If included in Debt Service here no need to deal separately with voluntary prepayments in "Excess Cashflow".
[92]         See footnote to "Finance Charges".  No need to add here if already included there.
[93]         See footnote to paragraph (d) of "Cashflow".
[94]         See footnote to paragraph (d) of "Cashflow".
[95]         The accounting treatment of Debt Purchase Transactions should be addressed only if the Agreement permits Borrowers to enter into Debt Purchase Transactions.  See footnote to Clause 31 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions).
[96]         An increase in EBITDA may result from the reclassification (as depreciation and interest) of expenses relating to old "operating leases" as a result of the introduction of new lease accounting standards under IFRS 16 in relation to accounting periods from 1 January 2019 or under other similar changes under other accounting regimes (see footnote to the definition of "Finance Lease").  Users should consider the impact of any such changes in the context of the Group's business and the Base Case Model and the extent to which any adjustments to this definition or to the relevant financial ratios may be appropriate.
[97]         NB:  See footnote to paragraph (b) of "Debt Service".
[98]         Include if New Shareholder Injections are included in Exceptional Items or Cashflow.
[99]         Include if this Agreement does not regulate Mezzanine debt buybacks.
[100]         The accounting treatment of Debt Purchase Transactions should be addressed only if the Agreement permits Borrowers to enter into Debt Purchase Transactions.  See footnote to Clause 31 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions).
[101]         NB:  If included here may be deleted from paragraph (c) of "Debt Service".
[102]         Insert the appropriate reference point for the applicable Accounting Principles (see footnote 103 below).
[103]         IFRS 16 will require most leases to appear as balance sheet liabilities in relation to accounting periods from 1 January 2019. Similar changes are expected to be made in other accounting regimes. Insert this exclusion if the commercial agreement is to exclude the effect of old "operating leases" appearing as balance sheet liabilities and insert the appropriate reference point for the applicable Accounting Principles. For example, the reference point of 1 January 2019 is only suitable if the applicable Accounting Principles are IFRS. If the Agreement is entered into before the accounting change under the applicable Accounting Principles takes effect, a reference to the Accounting Principles in force "as at the date of this Agreement" may be an appropriate reference point.
[104]         Lenders may wish to consider amendments, as appropriate, to reflect sanctions laws and regulations that may affect them depending on their jurisdiction of incorporation or business, for example US and EU sanctions (which may prohibit lenders from advancing funds to be made available to targets of any relevant sanctions authority, as well as other restrictions).  In addition, lenders in some jurisdictions should take advice in relation to possible conflict of laws that may impact on their ability to include clauses of this nature.

        If any clauses of this nature are included, users should note that some Lenders may have particular sensitivities to the amendment or waiver of any such clause.  Users should consider the extent to which Clause 42.3 (All Lender matters) should be supplemented to require all Lender consent for such amendment or waiver.
[105]         Remove reference to Mezzanine Facility if Mezzanine buyback is covered in the definition of "Debt Purchase Transaction" and related restrictions.
[106]         Content of this provision will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
[107]         This provision is of limited value as a scheme can be fully funded but still have a deficit.  In the context of the Pensions Act 2004, what is more important is whether the Group has sufficient reserves/assets to meet the contingent pension liabilities if those liabilities are crystallised at any time during the life of the loan.
[108]         This undertaking has been adapted to take account of the Pensions Act 2004.  Its purpose is to complement the pensions representation, to ensure that, other than to the extent disclosed, no Group member has or has had any connection or association with a defined benefit pension scheme.  This undertaking is also intended to ensure that no company which subsequently becomes a member of the Group has or has had any connection or association with such a pension scheme.  Its purpose is to try to ensure that (other than to the extent disclosed) there will be no Group liability for defined benefit pension scheme deficits.  
[109]         Paragraphs (e) and (f) of Clause 28.27 (Pensions) should only be included if there is a defined benefit occupational pension scheme within the Group.  
[110]         This undertaking should be included if there is not an equivalent undertaking in the relevant Transaction Security Document.  
[111]         Materiality may not be appropriate where Intellectual Property is a key part of the security package.
[112]         This Clause should be deleted if there is a separate syndication side letter.
[113]         Subject to negotiation as no grace periods apply to breaches of the clauses referred to in Clause 29.2 (Financial covenants and other obligations).
[114]         This Event of Default should only be included if there is a defined benefit occupational pension scheme within the Group or if this Agreement does not contain a covenant prohibiting the existence within the Group of defined benefit pension schemes in the future.  This Event of Default takes account of the Pensions Act 2004 and the power of the Pensions Regulator to require other members of the Group to provide financial support for the deficits in defined benefit pension schemes operated by other Group members.
[115]         Two (alternative) forms of Clause 31 are provided (see footnote to Clause 31 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions)).  Clause 30.1 (Assignments and transfers by the Lenders) should refer to whichever one is chosen to be included in the Agreement.
[116]         Two (alternative) forms of Clause 30.2 are provided.  The first option (entitled "Parent consultation") envisages that the Parent must be consulted before a transfer is made.
        The second option (entitled "Parent consent") envisages that the Parent's consent must be given before a transfer is made if the proposed New Lender is not named on the Pre-Approved New Lender List.
        The two forms of Clause 30.2 are mutually exclusive.  Accordingly, it is NOT recommended that users include both forms in the same Agreement.
[117]         Include if the second form of Clause 31 is used.  See footnote to Clause 31 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions).
[118]         If the Assignment Agreement is used in place of a Transfer Certificate in order to avoid a novation of rights/obligations for reasons relevant to a civil jurisdiction, local law advice should be sought to check the suitability of the Assignment Agreement due to the assumption of obligations referred to in paragraph (c)(iii) of Clause 30.7 (Procedure for assignment).
[119]         Two (alternative) forms of Clause 31 are provided.  The first option (entitled "Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions") envisages that members of the Group are not allowed to purchase their own debt under the Agreement and, depending on the definition of "Debt Purchase Transaction", the Mezzanine Facility Agreement.
        The second option (entitled "Debt Purchase Transactions") envisages that Borrowers are allowed, in certain circumstances, to purchase their own debt under the Agreement and regulates that process.
        The two forms of Clause 31 are mutually exclusive.  Accordingly, it is NOT recommended that users include both forms in the same Agreement.
        The Agreement envisages that one of the two alternative forms of Clause 31 is included in the Agreement.
[120]         Purchases of Revolving Facility Loans have not been permitted as purchase by assignment would, in any event, leave the assignor with the obligation to lend.  The same rationale applies to other undrawn facilities (e.g. capex facilities).  If a second lien facility is included provision would need to be made so that it could not be purchased while the "senior" facilities were outstanding.  Consideration may also be given to further restrictions (if any) as to the order in which Facilities may be bought.
[121]         It should be explicitly stated that for Financial Years prior to the first year that it is swept, Excess Cashflow shall be deemed to be zero.
[122]         If included the bracketed wording would effectively block purchases for the period from the end of one Financial Year until the annual accounts for that Financial Year are delivered.  
[123]         Bracketed wording to be included for amortising term loan facilities or if an Amortising Incremental Facility can be established. 
[124]         Depending on the exact undertakings contained within Clause 28 (General Undertakings) consider whether all or specified undertakings should be the subject of the exemption.
[125]         To be used where Borrowers may resign (under paragraph (b)) when they are the subject of a Third Party Disposal.
[126]         It is assumed that release of Security over assets disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Agreement (or pursuant to enforcement of Transaction Security) is dealt with in the trustee provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Clauses 13 (Non-Distressed Disposals) and 14 (Distressed Disposals and Appropriation) of the recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) are intended to cover these areas.
[127]         Only include words in brackets if optional Clause 36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
[128]         Users should consider including this wording if the optional Clause 36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
[129]         Include words in brackets if optional Clause 36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
[130]          If this Clause is included use the second option in Clause 1.4 (Third party rights).
[131]         For use where provisions are included to facilitate Ancillary Lenders reporting Ancillary Facilities comprising group overdraft facilities "net" to the UK regulator.  Use the first option if the commercial agreement is that such Ancillary Lenders are permitted to retain the proceeds of exercising set-off across accounts (without sharing those proceeds with the other Lenders) only within specified limits.  Use the second option if the commercial agreement is that such Ancillary Lenders are permitted to retain the proceeds of exercising set-off across accounts (without sharing those proceeds with other Lenders) without limit.  Users should note that the option chosen is likely to effect the extent to which such Ancillary Lenders are able to report group overdraft facilities on a net basis.  It is assumed that Users will obtain regulatory advice in relation to the ability to report such facilities "net".
[132]         Clause 36.6 (Partial payments) is not intended to include the ranking of Obligor liabilities under the Hedging Agreements in an enforcement scenario.  (It is assumed that this will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement - this is the case in the recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine)).  If it is used in this way (by cross-reference or otherwise) the Clause may require amendment.
[133]         Consider whether other Finance Documents should not require Majority Lender consent to be amended.
[134]         Include if the optional Clause 30.11 (Pro rata interest settlement) is included
[135]         Users should consider the extent to which an amendment or waiver relating to a deferral of any amount under the mandatory prepayment provisions in Clause 13 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation) should require all Lender or Majority Lender consent.  The language in square brackets should be included if the commercial agreement is that such amendments or waivers are to require Majority Lender consent only.  Note that the extent to which any amendments or waivers which change or relate to Clause 13 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation) itself are addressed in paragraph (h) of Clause 42.3 (All Lender matters) and any sensitivities are likely to be similar.  See the footnote to that paragraph. 
[136]         Users should consider the extent to which amendments and waivers which change or relate to the mandatory prepayment provisions in Clause 13 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation) should require all Lender or Majority Lender consent. A number of drafting options are provided and users should consider which, if any, of these options are suitable in the context of the relevant transaction and sensitivities which they may have.  For example, an individual Lender may be sensitive to the consequences of being unwillingly bound by a Majority Lender decision in respect of a waiver of, or amendment to: (i) any threshold levels set under Clause 13.2 (Disposal, Insurance and Acquisition Proceeds and Excess Cashflow); and (ii) the Obligors' obligation to prepay the Facilities on a change of control, flotation or sale of all the Group's assets under Clause 13.1 (Exit).
[137]         This paragraph may be removed if the Intercreditor Agreement covers this area.  (Clause 28 (Consents, Amendments and Override) of the recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) is intended to cover this area).
[138]         Insert if Clause 42.6 (Structural Adjustment) is included.
[139]         If paragraph (b) of Clause 42.7 (Excluded Commitments) is not included consider whether a snooze/lose concept should apply to this Clause 42.5 (Replacement of Screen Rate). 
[140]         The extent to which any amendments to the Transaction Security and guarantees should be included in the Structural Adjustment concept should be considered on a transaction specific basis, together with the extent of any qualification.
[141]         Users should note that this provision may not be appropriate in all cases for Lenders which are not Defaulting Lenders. Consider also whether there are any provisions which cannot be waived or amended using this provision for Lenders which are not Defaulting Lenders.
[142]         Insert agreed time period.
[143]         Include to the extent that paragraph (d) is included in the definition of "Defaulting Lender".
[144]         Insert agreed time period.
[145]         Include if optional Clause 30.10 (Security over Lenders' rights) is included.
[146]         Include this reference if the optional paragraph (b)(vii) of Clause 43.2 (Disclosure of Confidential Information) is included.
[147]         Term/Revolver etc.
[148]         This wording has been included to ensure that disclosure is made only for the purposes of enabling a numbering service provider to allocate an identification number to a syndicated facility agreement, one or more facilities made available under such facility agreement or any Obligor party to such facility agreement.  The purpose of disclosure is not therefore to enable products that are directly or indirectly related to a facility agreement, its facilities or its Obligors to be allocated an identification number.
[149]         The information listed in paragraph (a) reflects the information that is likely to be required to enable a numbering service provider ("NSP") to assign identification numbers/codes to this Agreement, the Facilities and their ranking.  Disclosure has been restricted to descriptive information about the Facility Agreement (including changes to that information) for two main reasons.  Firstly, because once delivered to the NSP that information will not be subject to any confidentiality obligations on the part of the NSP or subscribers to the NSP.  It has been assumed that as the NSP needs to disclose the information to its subscribers they would not be prepared to sign up to a confidentiality undertaking or require their subscribers to do so to protect Borrower confidential information.  However, no dialogue has been had with NSPs in this regard.
        The second reason for restricting the information that can be disclosed to NSPs is to limit the risk of that information being unpublished price-sensitive or inside-information (meaning, if it were known to the public it would be likely to have an effect on the price of securities issued by the relevant Borrower that are publicly traded).  If unpublished price-sensitive or inside information were disclosed to a NSP (with or without the consent of the Borrower) by a Lender in circumstances where that information will be disclosed only to subscribers of the NSP (and not to the public), that Lender and the individuals concerned could be guilty of an offence under the insider dealing/market abuse regime in the UK.  Restricting the information that can be disclosed by Lenders to NSP's to relatively anodyne and descriptive information helps to minimise the risk that the information will be unpublished price-sensitive or inside information.
        However, because of the potential seriousness of this issue, because it is possible to envisage circumstances where all or part of the information specified in paragraph (a) may be unpublished price-sensitive or inside information and because only the Obligors can know with certainty whether any of that information is unpublished price-sensitive or inside information, the permission also requires the Obligors to represent to the Lenders that none of that information is unpublished price-sensitive information.  The representation is contained in paragraph (c) as a means of ensuring reasonable steps have been taken to avoid inside or price-sensitive information being selectively disclosed with no confidentiality restrictions.
        In most cases where the relevant Obligor has publicly traded securities, the information that is listed in paragraph (a) would, in any event, need to be disclosed by that Obligor in accordance with the UK disclosure requirements on issuers of listed securities and so the representation should not be onerous for such Obligors.
[150]        This requirement has been limited to the Agent on the assumption that if the Agent requests an identification number, it will, in any event, require all Parties to use that number in communications etc.  If this is not the case, this clause can be deleted.
[151]         This wording is intended to make non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the agreement subject to English law.  However, if the document is used in a cross-border transaction where different transaction documents are governed by different governing laws, consider whether it is appropriate, in the context of that transaction, for English law to apply to non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the transaction documents which are not governed by English law.
[152]         Users should consider the extent to which this Clause may require amendment in light of the decision of the French Cour de cassation in Mme X v Rothschild.  For a discussion of the issues involved, see the LMA note entitled "Jurisdiction Clauses in LMA facility documentation" (available through the LMA website).
[153]         To the extent that the square bracketed wording relating to non-contractual obligations in Clause 47 (Governing law) is included, this wording should be included in paragraph (a) of Clause 48.1 (Jurisdiction of English Courts).
[154]         If no Original Lender is a UK Non-Bank Lender, delete the words in square brackets from the heading of this Part.
[155]         Each of these must be included if the Original Lender holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme and wishes that scheme to apply to the Agreement.
[156]         If no Original Lender is a UK Non-Bank Lender, delete this part of the Schedule and all references to it in the body of the Agreement.
[157]        If no Hedge Counterparties are Party to this Agreement at signing delete this part of the Schedule and all references to it in the body of the Agreement.
[158]         The extent to which Mandatory Costs are chargeable to the borrower on any transaction, and the method for calculating any such Mandatory Costs, is a matter for commercial agreement between the parties.  Users should refer to the LMA note entitled "Withdrawal of the Mandatory Costs Schedule" (available through the LMA website) for a discussion of some of the issues involved in formulating any calculation methodology.
[159]         Delete as applicable - each New Lender is required to confirm which of these three categories it falls within.
[160]        Include if New Lender comes within paragraph (i)(B) of the definition of Qualifying Lender in Clause 19.1 (Definitions).

[166]         This clause should follow the approach adopted as regards non-contractual obligations in Clause 47 (Governing Law).  This should be done (and this footnote deleted) before the Agreement is signed.
[167]         If the Assignment Agreement is used in place of a Transfer Certificate in order to avoid a novation of rights/obligations for reasons relevant to a civil jurisdiction, local law advice should be sought to check the suitability of the Assignment Agreement due to the assumption of obligations contained in paragraph 2(c).  This issue should be addressed at Primary documentation stage.  This footnote is not intended to be included in the scheduled form of Assignment Agreement in the signed Facilities Agreement.
[168]         Delete as applicable - each New Lender is required to confirm which of these three categories it falls within.

[182]         The current form of LMA Confidentiality Letter (Seller) or Confidentiality Letter (Purchaser) for the secondary trading of loans should be included in this Schedule.  In the case where primary syndication takes place after the Facility Agreement is signed, the current LMA Confidentiality and Front Running Letter should also be included to avoid confusion over which form of confidentiality letter is appropriate.
[183]         When completing the timetables, not all times/days should be determined by reference to the Utilisation Date.  In certain cases (ie in relation to Clause 8.2 (Unavailability of a Currency)) the time inserted should be determined by reference to the Quotation Day or the relevant day during the Interest Period.
[184]         NB may need to be renumbered if paragraphs (c) and (d) of Clause 6.5 (Issue of Letters of Credit) are not included.
[185]         NB may need to be renumbered if paragraphs (c) and (d) of Clause 6.5 (Issue of Letters of Credit) are not included.
[186]         This definition matches the definition of "Secured Obligations" in the LMA recommended form of Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine).  It may need to be amended if that form of Intercreditor Agreement is not used on the transaction documented by this Agreement.
