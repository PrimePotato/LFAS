SECTION 5
COSTS OF UTILISATION
15. INTEREST
15.1 Calculation of interest
The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable:
(a) Margin; [and]
(b) LIBOR [or, in relation to any Loan in euro, EURIBOR][or, in relation to any Loan in a Non-LIBOR Currency, the Benchmark Rate for that currency][; and
(c) Mandatory Cost, if any].
15.2 Payment of interest
(a) The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest on that Loan on the last day of each Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the dates falling at six Monthly intervals after the first day of the Interest Period).
(b) [If the Compliance Certificate received by the Agent which relates to the relevant Annual Financial Statements shows that a higher Margin should have applied during a certain period, then the Parent shall (or shall ensure the relevant Borrower shall) promptly pay to the Agent any amounts necessary to put the Agent and the Lenders in the position they would have been in had the appropriate rate of the Margin applied during such period.]
15.3 Default interest
(a) If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which, subject to paragraph?(b) below, is [???] per cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the Agent (acting reasonably).  Any interest accruing under this Clause?15.3 shall be immediately payable by the Obligor on demand by the Agent.
(b) If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan:
(i) the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to that Loan; and
(ii) the rate of interest applying to the overdue amount during that first Interest Period shall be [???] per cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have applied if the overdue amount had not become due.
(c) Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.
15.4 Notification of rates of interest
(a) The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Lenders and the relevant Borrower (or the Parent) of the determination of a rate of interest under this Agreement.

[In addition a Borrower (or the Parent on its behalf) may select an Interest Period of:
(i) (in relation to Facility [A] [B] [C] [an Amortising Incremental Facility]) a period of less than [one] Month, if necessary to ensure that there are [Facility A Loans] [Facility B Loans] [Facility C Loans] [Loans under that Amortising Incremental Facility] (with an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to or greater than the Repayment Instalment) which have an Interest Period ending on a Repayment Date relating to the relevant Facility for the Borrowers to make the Repayment Instalment due on that date; or
(ii) (in relation to the Revolving Facility) a period of less than [one] Month, if necessary to ensure that (when aggregated with the Available Facility for the Revolving Facility) there are Revolving Facility Loans (with an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to or greater than the Reduction Instalment) which have an Interest Period ending on a Reduction Date for the scheduled reduction to occur].
(e) An Interest Period for a Loan shall not extend beyond the Termination Date applicable to its Facility.
(f) Each Interest Period for a Term Loan shall start on the Utilisation Date or (if already made) on the last day of its preceding Interest Period.
(g) A Revolving Facility Loan has one Interest Period only.
(h) Prior to the Syndication Date, Interest Periods shall be one Month [or, in the case of a Loan in a Non-LIBOR Currency, the period specified in respect of that currency in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks)] or[, in each case,] such other period as the Agent and the Parent may agree and any Interest Period which would otherwise end during the Month preceding or extend beyond the Syndication Date shall end on the Syndication Date.
16.2 Changes to Interest Periods
(a) [Prior to determining the interest rate for a [Facility A Loan] [Facility B Loan] [Facility C Loan] [Loan under an Amortising Incremental Facility], the Agent may shorten an Interest Period for any [Facility A Loan] [Facility B Loan] [Facility C Loan] [Loan under that Amortising Incremental Facility] to ensure there are sufficient [Facility A Loans] [Facility B Loans] [Facility C Loans] [Loans under that Amortising Incremental Facility] (with an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to or greater than the relevant Repayment Instalment) which have an Interest Period ending on the relevant Repayment Date for the Borrowers to make the relevant Repayment Instalment due on that date.]

(i) relate to:
(A) Facility A Loans made to the same Borrower[; or
(B) Incremental Facility Loans made under the same Incremental Facility and to the same Borrower]; and
(ii) end on the same date,
those Facility A Loans [or, as the case may be, Incremental Facility Loans] will, unless that Borrower (or the Parent on its behalf) specifies to the contrary in the Selection Notice for the next Interest Period, be consolidated into, and treated as, a single Facility A Loan [or, as the case may be, a single Incremental Facility Loan,] on the last day of the Interest Period.
(b) Subject to Clause?4.4 (Maximum number of Utilisations), and Clause?5.3 (Currency and amount) if a Borrower (or the Parent on its behalf) requests in a Selection Notice that a Facility A Loan [or an Incremental Facility Loan] be divided into two or more Facility A Loans [or Incremental Facility Loans], that Loan will, on the last day of its Interest Period, be so divided with Base Currency Amounts specified in that Selection Notice, having an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to the Base Currency Amount of the Loan immediately before its division.

(a) guarantees to each Finance Party punctual performance by each other Obligor of all that Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;
(b) undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever another Obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and
(c) agrees with each Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify that Finance Party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due.  The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause?24 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.
24.2 Continuing guarantee
This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
24.3 Reinstatement
If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause?24 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.
24.4 Waiver of defences
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause?24 will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause?24, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause?24 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including:
(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;
(b) the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;
(c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;
(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;
(e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of a Finance Document or any other document or security including, without limitation, any change in the purpose of, any extension of or increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any Finance Document or other document or security;
(f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or
(g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.
24.5 Guarantor intent
Without prejudice to the generality of Clause?24.4 (Waiver of defences), each Guarantor expressly confirms that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Finance Documents and/or any facility or amount made available under any of the Finance Documents for the purposes of or in connection with any of the following:  business acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities; refinancing any other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any other variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available from time to time; and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing.
24.6 Immediate recourse
Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause?24.  This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.
24.7 Appropriations
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:
(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
(b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this Clause?24.
24.8 Deferral of Guarantors' rights
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause?24:
(a) to be indemnified by an Obligor;
(b) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;
(c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by any Finance Party;
(d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause?24.1 (Guarantee and indemnity);
(e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or
(f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.
If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause?36 (Payment mechanics).
24.9 Release of Guarantors' right of contribution
If any Guarantor (a "Retiring Guarantor") ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Guarantor then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:
(a) that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and
(b) each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.
24.10 Additional security
This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.
24.11 Guarantee limitations81
[This guarantee does not apply to any liability to the extent that it would result in this guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of sections 678 or 679 of the Companies Act 2006 [or any equivalent and applicable provisions under the laws of the Original Jurisdiction of the relevant Guarantor] and, with respect to any Additional Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the Accession Deed applicable to such Additional Guarantor.]

AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES
(A) Considerations
In determining what Security will be provided in support of the Facilities (and any related hedging arrangements in respect of the types of liabilities and/or risks which the Hedging Letter requires to be hedged) the following matters will be taken into account.  Security shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it would:
(a) result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference or thin capitalisation laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction;
(b) result in a significant risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of Security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal liability; or
(c) result in costs that, in the opinion of the Agent, are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that Security.
For the avoidance of doubt, in these Agreed Security Principles, "cost" includes, but is not limited to, income tax cost, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for the continuance of any Security, stamp duties, out-of-pocket expenses, and other fees and expenses directly incurred by the relevant grantor of Security or any of its direct or indirect owners, subsidiaries or Affiliates.
(B) Obligations to be Secured
1. Subject to (A) (Considerations) and to paragraph?2 below, the obligations to be secured are the Secured Obligations (as defined below).  The Security is to be granted in favour of the Security Agent on behalf of each Lender from time to time, and the Agent, the Arranger, the Issuing Bank, any Hedge Counterparty and the agent, the arranger(s) and the lenders under the Mezzanine Facility Agreement.
For ease of reference, the following definitions should, to the extent legally possible, be incorporated into each Transaction Security Document (with the capitalised terms used in them having the meaning given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement):
"Secured Obligations" means all the Liabilities and all other present and future liabilities and obligations at any time due, owing or incurred by any member of the Group and by each Debtor to any Secured Party under the Debt Documents, both actual and contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly and as principal or surety or in any other capacity.176
"Secured Parties" means the Security Agent, any Receiver or Delegate and each of the Primary Creditors from time to time but, in the case of each Primary Creditor, only if it is a party to the Intercreditor Agreement or has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement, in the appropriate capacity, pursuant to clause?[22.11] (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement.177
2. The secured obligations will be limited:
2.1 to avoid any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules or the laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; and
2.2 to avoid any risk to officers of the relevant member of the Group that is granting Transaction Security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or civil or criminal or personal liability.
(C) General
Where appropriate, defined terms in the Transaction Security Documents should mirror those in this Agreement.
The parties to this Agreement agree to negotiate the form of each Transaction Security Document in good faith and will ensure that all documentation required to be entered into as a condition precedent to first drawdown under this Agreement (or immediately thereafter) is in a finally agreed form as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.  The form of guarantee is set out in Clause?24 (Guarantee and Indemnity) of this Agreement and, with respect to any Additional Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the Accession Deed applicable to such Additional Guarantor.
The Security shall, to the extent possible under local law, be enforceable on the occurrence of [an Event of Default] / [an Event of Default in respect of which the Agent has exercised any of its rights under Clause?29.20 (Acceleration) (or the agent under the Mezzanine Facility Agreement has exercised any of its rights under clause?[??] of the Mezzanine Facility Agreement)].
(D) Undertakings/Representations and Warranties
Any representations, warranties or undertakings which are required to be included in any Transaction Security Document shall reflect (to the extent to which the subject matter of such representation, warranty and undertaking is the same as the corresponding representation, warranty and undertaking in this Agreement) the commercial deal set out in this Agreement (save to the extent that Secured Parties' local counsel deem it necessary to include any further provisions (or deviate from those contained in this Agreement) in order to protect or preserve the Security granted to the Secured Parties).

3 	The Agreement does not contain provisions for appointment of the Security Agent or other trust provisions.  It is assumed these are contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.  (The LMA recommended form of Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains such trust provisions).  Note that if security is granted over assets subject to non-English law a trustee arrangement may not be appropriate.
4 	Users should note that if the Facilities Agreement is amended to envisage a Term Facility with a nominal amortisation (and the potential to establish an Incremental Facility with a similar amortisation structure is envisaged) this definition should be amended and Clause 11 (Repayment), Clause 12 (Illegality, voluntary prepayment and cancellation), and Clause 13 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation) (and related provisions) adapted to address the appropriate treatment of such Incremental Facilities.
5 	This definition should be tailored to the commercial requirements on a transaction specific basis.
6 	If using Historic Screen Rates as a fallback option users should consider the length of this period in the context of (a)?the maturities for which the applicable Screen Rates are quoted and (b)?the period of time for which the use of a Historic Screen Rate is considered appropriate.
7 	Delete if no Hedge Counterparties are Party to this Agreement at signing.
8 	This Agreement assumes that the Hedging Letter is prepared using the recommended form of LMA Hedging Letter for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine).  Users should consider the extent to which the hedging strategy documented in the Hedging Letter should (or should not) require hedging of interest rate and/or exchange rate risks in relation to any Incremental Facility.
9 	Users should consider the extent to which such a separate condition precedent independent of paragraph (a)(iv) of Clause 10.6 (Conditions to establishment) should automatically apply to every Incremental Facility for the benefit of the relevant Incremental Facility Lenders or whether the extent to which such a separate condition precedent is required should be agreed by the relevant Incremental Facility Lenders and the Parent in the relevant Incremental Facility Notice.
10 	Users should note that the Banking Act 2009 allows for the effectiveness of this limb to be disapplied in certain circumstances and that it is possible that, in some contexts, regulators may constrain borrowers from agreeing to its inclusion.
11 	Insert if paragraph?(f) is not included.
12 	Insert if paragraph?(f) is included.
13 	This definition (other than paragraph?(f) and the carve-out to paragraph?(h)) is based on the Bankruptcy event of default definition contained in ISDA Master Agreement documentation.
14 	Delete if no Hedge Counterparties will be party to the Intercreditor Agreement at signing.
15 	This Agreement assumes that the Intercreditor Agreement is prepared using the recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine).
16 	If specifying the rounding convention users may wish to consider altering this suggested convention to that used in any corresponding hedging product.
17 	Users should note that ICE LIBOR (formerly known as BBA LIBOR) is produced for a limited range of tenors and currencies.  See the Intercontinental Exchange Group website for more information.
18 	Events (such as the occurrence of material adverse change) under the Acquisition Agreement which may prevent Completion occurring may be included here.
19 	See the LMA Memorandum on "Auditor choice provisions in LMA facility documentation" which is available through the LMA website for further information.
20 	Insert details of any currency that is, or may be, available under the Agreement for which the interest rate is not intended to be determined by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR.  The details in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks) must be completed for each Non-LIBOR Currency.
21 	Option 1 as described in footnote?23 below.
22 	Option 2 as described in footnote?23 below.
23 	Provisions allowing Lenders to control an entity's choice of auditor are prohibited under EU legislation.  Two alternative formulations are provided.  The first is intended for use where the EU legislation is applicable to the Parent. It does not seek to control the Parent's choice of auditor.  The second is intended for use where the EU legislation is not applicable to the Parent.  It allows Lenders to control the Parent's choice of auditor.  Users will need to consider the options carefully (and see the LMA Memorandum on "Auditor choice provisions in LMA facility documentation" which is available through the LMA website for further information).  If the EU legislation is applicable to the Parent but is not applicable to one or more significant members of the Group it may be appropriate to amend these provisions to allow Lenders to control those Group members' choice of auditor.
24 	NB If there are assets subject to fixed charges under any Transaction Security Document consider excluding them from these paragraphs?due to risk of fixed charges being characterised as floating charges.
25 	To the extent that there are to be further restrictions on payments of dividends on the Preference Shares these should be set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
26 	To the extent that there are to be further restrictions on payments of these dividends these should be set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
27 	NB If there are assets subject to fixed charges under any Transaction Security Document consider excluding them from these paragraphs?due to risk of fixed charges being characterised as floating charges.
28 	Insert if the interest rate for euro is determined by reference to EURIBOR.
29 	The potential for subsequent intra-day correction, recalculation or republication of an originally published Screen Rate can raise difficult issues that should be considered carefully to ensure that the parties achieve the desired commercial outcome.  Users should carefully consider the extent to which excluding the effects of any such correction, recalculation or republication is suitable for the transaction in question.  See the LMA note entitled "ICE LIBOR and EURIBOR refixing policies and LMA facility documentation" (available through the LMA website).
30 	This definition is intended to have the effect of referencing (i) the LIBOR rate which is currently known as ICE LIBOR and (ii) the euro interbank offered rate which is currently known as Euribor, irrespective of any change of administrator or publisher occurring after the date of the Agreement.  It may not be suitable if this effect does not represent the commercial agreement.  Users should note that changes to this definition may have implications under associated interest rate hedging arrangements.
31 	The proviso is aimed at excluding CDOs of sponsors which are run independently to their private equity business. 
32 	Insert if the Super Majority concept is used in Clause?42.6 (Structural Adjustment)
33 	Note that some Lenders take the view that once an Event of Default has occurred it should be continuing unless the Lenders have waived it in accordance with Clause?42 (Amendments and Waivers).
34 	Users should consider carefully the appropriate currency definition(s) in the context of the transaction and should consider defining any other currency referred to in the Agreement.
35 	Insert agreed time period.
36 	The Transaction Security and guarantees provided under this Agreement may not in all jurisdictions continue to secure or guarantee the increased Commitment or be for the benefit of the Increase Lender.  It is the responsibility of the Increase Lender to ascertain whether any other documents or other formalities are required to confirm the Transaction Security/guarantees in any jurisdiction and/or for it to benefit from such Transaction Security and/or guarantees and, if so, to arrange for execution of those documents and completion of those formalities.
37 	The funding of acquisitions may fall within the scope of general corporate purposes depending on the company's objects (which may be restricted by its Constitutional Documents) and, therefore, should be expressly excluded if the Revolving Facility is not intended to be used to fund acquisitions.
38 	When specifying a pre-approved Optional Currency users should consider the extent to which that currency should be listed as a Non-LIBOR Currency and the agreed Screen Rate (and related terms) included in Schedule 17 (Other Benchmarks).
	If the Clause?is amended to allow for subsequent approval of Optional Currencies with less than all Lender consent, users should consider providing for a mechanic to agree a suitable Screen Rate (and related terms) at the same time.
39 	Consider in light of Triodos Bank NV v. Ashley Charles Dobbs.
40 	Lenders may wish to consider any credit risk connected with depositing an amount in an account with the Issuing Bank.
41 	Users should ensure that the time period given for a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender to provide cash collateral under paragraph?(a) and the amount of notice to be given by a Borrower when requesting the issue of a Letter of Credit are such that if a Lender is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender at the time the Issuing Bank is informed of a proposed Letter of Credit: (i) the Non-Acceptable L/C Lender will be obliged to provide cash collateral prior to the relevant Utilisation Date; and (ii) the Borrower will have time in which to elect to provide cash cover itself if necessary.
42 	Users should be aware that giving Obligors rights of withdrawal involves a risk that any fixed security interest might be recharacterised as a floating security interest.
43 	For use where provisions are included to facilitate Ancillary Lenders reporting Ancillary Facilities comprising group overdraft facilities "net" to the UK regulator.  Use the first option if the commercial agreement is that such Ancillary Lenders are permitted to demand repayment only within prescribed limits.  Use the second option if the commercial agreement is that Ancillary Lenders are not subject to such limits.  Users should note that the option chosen is likely to affect the extent to which such Ancillary Lenders are able to report group overdraft facilities on a "net" basis.  It is assumed that users will obtain regulatory advice in relation to the ability to report such facilities "net".
44 	Loss sharing may not be appropriate in all circumstances. Where it is considered to be appropriate it may be necessary to discuss whether sharing arrangements between the Lenders and Ancillary Lenders in relation to remuneration are also appropriate.
45 	Two (alternative) forms of Clause?10.1 are provided.  The first option (entitled "Selection of Incremental Facility Lenders") requires that existing Lenders are given the right of first refusal to participate on a pro rata basis in any proposed Incremental Facility.  The second option (entitled "Incremental Facility Lenders") allows the Parent to select any entity to participate in a proposed Incremental Facility provided that such entity is, optionally, not a Sponsor Affiliate or a member of the Group.  The two forms of Clause?10.1 are mutually exclusive.  Accordingly, it is NOT recommended that users include both forms in the same Agreement.  The Agreement envisages that one of the two alternative forms of Clause?10.1 is included in the Agreement.
46 	Include if the first form of Clause 10.1 (entitled "Selection of Incremental Facility Lenders") is used.  
47 	Include if the first form of Clause?10.1 (entitled "Selection of Incremental Facility Lenders") is used. 
48 	Include if the first form of Clause?10.1 (entitled "Selection of Incremental Facility Lenders") is used.
49 	Include if the second form of Clause?10.1 (entitled "Incremental Facility Lenders") is used.
50 	Users should note that restrictions on the terms of Incremental Facilities should be considered on a transaction specific basis.  Users should consider which, if any, of the optional restrictions for which drafting is provided in Clause?10.5 (Restrictions on Incremental Facility Terms and fees) are appropriate in the context of the transaction.
51 	Users should note that changes will be required to this Agreement and the LMA Intercreditor Agreement (Senior/Mezzanine) if an Incremental Facility is capable of being denominated in any currency other than the Base Currency.
52 	This Agreement restricts the quantum of the Incremental Facilities by reference to a fixed numerical limit.  Users should note that the extent to which this is appropriate should be considered on a transaction specific basis.
53 	Users should note that the inclusion of this automatic termout mechanic in respect of a Defaulting Lender's participation in Revolving Facility Loans may have the result that the Revolving Facility is not always drawn on a pro rata basis and that, accordingly, a Defaulting Lender whose participation in Revolving Facility Loans is termed out in this way may suffer a disproportionate loss if the Borrower defaults when the only Loans outstanding under the Revolving Facility are Separate Loans.
54 	Users should note that it may not be necessary to address the effect of cancellations of Commitments on Repayment Instalments where those Repayment Instalments are expressed as a percentage of outstandings.
55 	There may be a different treatment for voluntary and mandatory prepayments in which case this paragraph?may need to be split in two.
56 	This period needs to be an appropriate period in the context of the notice period for voluntary prepayments.
57 	This Agreement envisages the use of one Screen Rate only per currency.  Users should consider the extent to which available Interest Periods should be restricted to tenors for which Screen Rates are available or can be interpolated from those Screen Rates.
58 	Clause?17.1 (Unavailability of Screen Rate) provides for a waterfall of fallbacks if a Screen Rate is unavailable.  Two (alternative) forms of Clause?17.1 (Unavailability of Screen Rate) are provided.  The first form should be used if the commercial agreement is that Historic Screen Rates are to be used as an intermediate fallback before the use of reference banks or cost of funds.  The second form should be used if the commercial agreement is that Historic Screen Rates are not to be used as such an intermediate fallback.
59 	The timings in this Clause?are suggestions only and may need adjustment to accord with the Agent's and Reference Banks' operational requirements. 
60 	Users should consider whether the Parent's rights under Clause?12.6 (Right of cancellation and repayment in relation to a single Lender or Issuing Bank) and Clause?42.8 (Replacement of Lender) should be extended to apply to a Lender making a notification to the Agent under Clause?17.3 (Market disruption).
61 	Users should consider whether Clause?17.4 (Cost of funds) should be amended to allow the relevant Borrower to revoke the Utilisation Request relating to a Loan which falls to be priced on a cost of funds basis.
62 	Include if cost of funds is not calculated on a weighted average basis.
63 	Include if cost of funds is not calculated on a weighted average basis.
64 	Include if cost of funds is calculated on a weighted average basis.
65 	NB:  This does not include commitment fee on any Revolving Facility Commitment blocked for use as an Ancillary Facility.  Commitment fees on Ancillary Facilities are to be dealt with in Ancillary Documents.
66 	This clause?is drafted on the assumption that payments made by the Obligor(s) may be subject to withholding tax (if any) under United Kingdom law and not under the law of any other jurisdiction.  If this is not the case and the Obligor(s) is/are to gross-up payments, this Clause?will need to be modified, in particular paragraphs?(d), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (l) of Clause?19.2 (Tax Gross-up) and the related definitions.  If the "Treaty Lender" concept is used, always check the wording of relevant Treaties.
	This clause, and in particular the definition of "Qualifying Lender", should always be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Consideration should also be given as to whether the representation in Clause?25.10 (Deduction of Tax) requires amendment.
67 	Users should consider expanding this definition if inclusion of pension funds among the lending syndicate is envisaged.  Users should refer to the tax-gross up provisions in the recommended form of LMA Term Facility Agreement for use in Pan-European Private Placements for suitable language.  Amendments will need to be made to: (a) the definitions of "Qualifying Lender" and "Tax Confirmation"; (b) paragraphs (d)(ii) and (d)(iii) of Clause 19.2 (Tax gross-up); (c) paragraph (a)(ii) of Clause 25.10 (Deduction of Tax); and (d) the forms of Tax Confirmation set out in Schedule 5 (Form of Transfer Certificate), Schedule 6 (Form of Assignment Agreement), Schedule 15 (Form of Increase Confirmation) and Schedule 19 (Form of Incremental Facility Lender Certificate).
68 	This is a complex area and in each case relevant treaties should be reviewed and, if appropriate, additional wording inserted to apportion risk as agreed by the Parties.
69 	If UK Non-Bank Lenders are to be envisaged and this definition is, therefore, included but no Original Lender is a UK Non-Bank Lender:
* delete this paragraph?(i);
* delete Part III of Schedule 1 (The Original Parties); and
* delete the words "other than UK Non-Bank Lenders" from the heading of Part II of Schedule 1 (The Original Parties).
	Do not, however, delete this definition, as a UK Non-Bank Lender may become a Lender after the date of this Agreement.
70 	This provision does not operate in an international context, so where there is an international context, this wording should be reviewed and updated accordingly. 
71 	This provision does not operate for the benefit of non-Finance Parties and whether this is correct should be considered on a case by case basis. 
72 	Paragraphs?(e), (f), (g) and (h) of Clause?19.8 (FATCA information) may be used for loans entered into with US borrowers (or loans where a US borrower may become an Additional Borrower).  
73	The form of increased costs clause?in this Agreement is drafted in deliberately wide terms in an attempt to cover all circumstances which could increase a Lender's costs as a result of a change in law or regulation.  The European legislation (often referred to as "CRD IV") which implements the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposed new standards for bank capital and liquidity requirements (labelled "Basel III") has come into force and potentially involves greater costs than those envisaged by Basel III.  Users may wish to consider whether to supplement the clause?to address expressly the extent to which both Basel III costs and CRD IV costs are intended to be within, or outside, the scope of the clause.
74	Basel II was finalised in 2004 and implemented in Europe during 2007 and so it may not be necessary to include a Basel II carve out from the increased costs clause?where the syndicate consists of European Lenders. If it is agreed by the parties to exclude Basel II from the increased costs clause, and for example this may be relevant where there are US Lenders in the syndicate as Basel II has not been fully implemented in the US, then users should note that elements of the Basel III papers amend the Basel II paper and so care needs to be taken with the drafting of the carve out. The following provision may be inserted at the end of this paragraph?(a) of Clause?20.3 (Exceptions) to address this point:
	"(v)	attributable to the implementation or application of or compliance with the "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, a Revised Framework" published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2004 in the form existing on the date of this Agreement (but excluding any amendment arising out of Basel III) ("Basel II") or any other law or regulation which implements Basel II (whether such implementation, application or compliance is by a government, regulator, Finance Party or any of its Affiliates)." 
		The following definition should be added to paragraph?(b) of Clause?20.1 (Increased costs):
		""Basel III" means:
	(A)	the agreements on capital requirements, a leverage ratio and liquidity standards contained in "Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems", "Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring" and "Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer" published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010, each as amended, supplemented or restated;
	(B)	the rules for global systemically important banks contained in "Global systemically important banks: assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement ? Rules text" published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in November 2011, as amended, supplemented or restated; and
	(C)	any further guidance or standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision relating to "Basel III"."
	Users should note that this definition of Basel III is deliberately wide and includes future Basel III publications.  It is, therefore, unlikely to be suitable to describe Basel III in the context of excluding Basel III costs from the scope of the increased costs clause?generally.
75 	Users should consider including this wording if the optional Clause?36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
76 	Include words in brackets if optional Clause?36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
77 	To the extent that an equivalent indemnity is included in the Intercreditor Agreement the indemnity in this Clause?21.4 (Indemnity to the Security Agent) can be removed to avoid unnecessary overlap.  (The recommended forms of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains an equivalent indemnity at clause?24.1 (Indemnity to the Security Agent)).
78 	To the extent that an equivalent indemnity to the Security Agent is included in the Intercreditor Agreement the Security Agent can be removed from the coverage of the indemnity in Clause?23.1 (Transaction expenses) to avoid unnecessary overlap.  (The recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains an equivalent indemnity to the Security Agent at clause?23.1 (Transaction expenses)).
79 	To the extent that an equivalent provision is included in the Intercreditor Agreement this provision can be removed to avoid unnecessary overlap. (The recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains an equivalent provision at clause?21.17 (Security Agent's management time and additional remuneration)).
80 	To the extent that an equivalent indemnity to the Security Agent is included in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent can be removed from the coverage of the indemnity in Clause?23.4 (Enforcement and preservation costs) to avoid unnecessary overlap.  (The recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) contains an equivalent indemnity to the Security Agent at clause?23.3 (Enforcement and preservation costs).)
81 	To the extent that any limitations are to apply to this guarantee, consideration should be given to whether those limitations should be extended to all indemnities and other assurances against loss in the Finance Documents, Hedging Agreements and the Mezzanine Finance Documents.
82 	Lenders may wish to consider amendments, as appropriate, to reflect sanctions laws and regulations that may affect them depending on their jurisdiction of incorporation or business, for example US and EU sanctions (which may prohibit lenders from advancing funds to be made available to targets of any relevant sanctions authority, as well as other restrictions).  In addition, lenders in some jurisdictions should take advice in relation to possible conflict of laws that may impact on their ability to include clauses?of this nature.  For further information see LMA Guidance Note: United States and European Union Sanctions (available through the LMA website). 
	If any clauses?of this nature are included, users should note that some Lenders may have particular sensitivities to the amendment or waiver of any such clause.  Users should consider the extent to which Clause?42.3 (All Lender matters) should be supplemented to require all Lender consent for such amendment or waiver.
83 	This representation should be considered on a case-by-case basis and modified or deleted as appropriate.  If tax other than UK tax may be relevant, this should be taken into account.
84 	Include if paragraph?(i)(B) of the definition of Qualifying Lender is included in Clause?19.1 (Definitions).
85 	Include if paragraph?(ii) of the definition of Qualifying Lender is included in Clause?19.1 (Definitions).
86 	This representation should only be included if there are not and never have been any defined benefit occupational pension schemes (i.e. final salary pension schemes) within the Group (other than to the extent disclosed) and the Lenders want this position confirmed by the Obligors at the outset.  This representation does not need to be repeated if the undertaking contained in paragraph?(b) of Clause?28.27 (Pensions) is included because the undertaking provides the ongoing obligation on the Group not to have such pension schemes.  
	This representation has been included to take account of the Pensions Act 2004, which effectively makes all members of the Group responsible for the deficits in any defined benefit occupational pension schemes which are operated by any member of the Group.
87	See the footnote to the definition of "Parent's Auditors".
88 	With regard to Original Obligors, it is assumed that "know your customer" identification procedures will be complied with prior to execution of this Agreement.
89 	Consider whether other types of shares/investments which might be classified as debt under the Accounting Principles should be included.
90 	NB:  See paragraph?(f) of "EBITDA".  If paragraph (f) of "EBITDA" is not included this may need to be amended.
91 	See paragraph?(b) of "Excess Cashflow".  If included in Debt Service here no need to deal separately with voluntary prepayments in "Excess Cashflow".
92 	See footnote to "Finance Charges".  No need to add here if already included there.
93 	See footnote to paragraph?(d) of "Cashflow".
94 	See footnote to paragraph?(d) of "Cashflow".
95 	The accounting treatment of Debt Purchase Transactions should be addressed only if the Agreement permits Borrowers to enter into Debt Purchase Transactions.  See footnote to Clause 31 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions).
96 	An increase in EBITDA may result from the reclassification (as depreciation and interest) of expenses relating to old "operating leases" as a result of the introduction of new lease accounting standards under IFRS 16 in relation to accounting periods from 1 January 2019 or under other similar changes under other accounting regimes (see footnote to the definition of "Finance Lease").  Users should consider the impact of any such changes in the context of the Group's business and the Base Case Model and the extent to which any adjustments to this definition or to the relevant financial ratios may be appropriate.
97 	NB:  See footnote to paragraph?(b) of "Debt Service".
98 	Include if New Shareholder Injections are included in Exceptional Items or Cashflow.
99 	Include if this Agreement does not regulate Mezzanine debt buybacks.
100 	The accounting treatment of Debt Purchase Transactions should be addressed only if the Agreement permits Borrowers to enter into Debt Purchase Transactions.  See footnote to Clause 31 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions).
101 	NB:  If included here may be deleted from paragraph?(c) of "Debt Service".
102 	Insert the appropriate reference point for the applicable Accounting Principles (see footnote 103 below).
103 	IFRS 16 will require most leases to appear as balance sheet liabilities in relation to accounting periods from 1 January 2019. Similar changes are expected to be made in other accounting regimes. Insert this exclusion if the commercial agreement is to exclude the effect of old "operating leases" appearing as balance sheet liabilities and insert the appropriate reference point for the applicable Accounting Principles. For example, the reference point of 1 January 2019 is only suitable if the applicable Accounting Principles are IFRS. If the Agreement is entered into before the accounting change under the applicable Accounting Principles takes effect, a reference to the Accounting Principles in force "as at the date of this Agreement" may be an appropriate reference point.
104 	Lenders may wish to consider amendments, as appropriate, to reflect sanctions laws and regulations that may affect them depending on their jurisdiction of incorporation or business, for example US and EU sanctions (which may prohibit lenders from advancing funds to be made available to targets of any relevant sanctions authority, as well as other restrictions).  In addition, lenders in some jurisdictions should take advice in relation to possible conflict of laws that may impact on their ability to include clauses?of this nature.  For further information see LMA Guidance Note: United States and European Union Sanctions (available through the LMA website).
	If any clauses?of this nature are included, users should note that some Lenders may have particular sensitivities to the amendment or waiver of any such clause.  Users should consider the extent to which Clause?42.3 (All Lender matters) should be supplemented to require all Lender consent for such amendment or waiver.
105 	Remove reference to Mezzanine Facility if Mezzanine buyback is covered in the definition of "Debt Purchase Transaction" and related restrictions.
106 	Content of this provision will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
107 	This provision is of limited value as a scheme can be fully funded but still have a deficit.  In the context of the Pensions Act 2004, what is more important is whether the Group has sufficient reserves/assets to meet the contingent pension liabilities if those liabilities are crystallised at any time during the life of the loan.
108 	This undertaking has been adapted to take account of the Pensions Act 2004.  Its purpose is to complement the pensions representation, to ensure that, other than to the extent disclosed, no Group member has or has had any connection or association with a defined benefit pension scheme.  This undertaking is also intended to ensure that no company which subsequently becomes a member of the Group has or has had any connection or association with such a pension scheme.  Its purpose is to try to ensure that (other than to the extent disclosed) there will be no Group liability for defined benefit pension scheme deficits.  
109 	Paragraphs?(e) and (f) of Clause?28.27 (Pensions) should only be included if there is a defined benefit occupational pension scheme within the Group.  
110 	This undertaking should be included if there is not an equivalent undertaking in the relevant Transaction Security Document.  
111 	Materiality may not be appropriate where Intellectual Property is a key part of the security package.
112 	This Clause?should be deleted if there is a separate syndication side letter.
113 	Subject to negotiation as no grace periods apply to breaches of the clauses?referred to in Clause?29.2 (Financial covenants and other obligations).
114 	This Event of Default should only be included if there is a defined benefit occupational pension scheme within the Group or if this Agreement does not contain a covenant prohibiting the existence within the Group of defined benefit pension schemes in the future.  This Event of Default takes account of the Pensions Act 2004 and the power of the Pensions Regulator to require other members of the Group to provide financial support for the deficits in defined benefit pension schemes operated by other Group members.
115 	Two (alternative) forms of Clause?31 are provided (see footnote to Clause 31 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions)).  Clause?30.1 (Assignments and transfers by the Lenders) should refer to whichever one is chosen to be included in the Agreement.
116 	Two (alternative) forms of Clause?30.2 are provided.  The first option (entitled "Parent consultation") envisages that the Parent must be consulted before a transfer is made.
	The second option (entitled "Parent consent") envisages that the Parent's consent must be given before a transfer is made if the proposed New Lender is not named on the Pre-Approved New Lender List.
	The two forms of Clause?30.2 are mutually exclusive.  Accordingly, it is NOT recommended that users include both forms in the same Agreement.
117 	Include if the second form of Clause 31 is used.  See footnote to Clause 31 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions).
118 	If the Assignment Agreement is used in place of a Transfer Certificate in order to avoid a novation of rights/obligations for reasons relevant to a civil jurisdiction, local law advice should be sought to check the suitability of the Assignment Agreement due to the assumption of obligations referred to in paragraph?(c)(iii) of Clause?30.7 (Procedure for assignment).
119 	Two (alternative) forms of Clause?31 are provided.  The first option (entitled "Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions") envisages that members of the Group are not allowed to purchase their own debt under the Agreement and, depending on the definition of "Debt Purchase Transaction", the Mezzanine Facility Agreement.
	The second option (entitled "Debt Purchase Transactions") envisages that Borrowers are allowed, in certain circumstances, to purchase their own debt under the Agreement and regulates that process.
	The two forms of Clause?31 are mutually exclusive.  Accordingly, it is NOT recommended that users include both forms in the same Agreement.
	The Agreement envisages that one of the two alternative forms of Clause?31 is included in the Agreement.
120 	Purchases of Revolving Facility Loans have not been permitted as purchase by assignment would, in any event, leave the assignor with the obligation to lend.  The same rationale applies to other undrawn facilities (e.g. capex facilities).  If a second lien facility is included provision would need to be made so that it could not be purchased while the "senior" facilities were outstanding.  Consideration may also be given to further restrictions (if any) as to the order in which Facilities may be bought.
121 	It should be explicitly stated that for Financial Years prior to the first year that it is swept, Excess Cashflow shall be deemed to be zero.
122 	If included the bracketed wording would effectively block purchases for the period from the end of one Financial Year until the annual accounts for that Financial Year are delivered.  
123 	Bracketed wording to be included for amortising term loan facilities or if an Amortising Incremental Facility can be established. 
124 	Depending on the exact undertakings contained within Clause?28 (General Undertakings) consider whether all or specified undertakings should be the subject of the exemption.
125 	To be used where Borrowers may resign (under paragraph?(b)) when they are the subject of a Third Party Disposal.
126 	It is assumed that release of Security over assets disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Agreement (or pursuant to enforcement of Transaction Security) is dealt with in the trustee provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Clauses?13 (Non-Distressed Disposals) and 14 (Distressed Disposals and Appropriation) of the recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) are intended to cover these areas.
127 	Only include words in brackets if optional Clause?36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
128 	Users should consider including this wording if the optional Clause?36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
129 	Include words in brackets if optional Clause?36.11 (Disruption to payment systems etc.) has been included.
130  	If this Clause?is included use the second option in Clause?1.4 (Third party rights).
131 	For use where provisions are included to facilitate Ancillary Lenders reporting Ancillary Facilities comprising group overdraft facilities "net" to the UK regulator.  Use the first option if the commercial agreement is that such Ancillary Lenders are permitted to retain the proceeds of exercising set-off across accounts (without sharing those proceeds with the other Lenders) only within specified limits.  Use the second option if the commercial agreement is that such Ancillary Lenders are permitted to retain the proceeds of exercising set-off across accounts (without sharing those proceeds with other Lenders) without limit.  Users should note that the option chosen is likely to effect the extent to which such Ancillary Lenders are able to report group overdraft facilities on a net basis.  It is assumed that Users will obtain regulatory advice in relation to the ability to report such facilities "net".
132 	Clause?36.6 (Partial payments) is not intended to include the ranking of Obligor liabilities under the Hedging Agreements in an enforcement scenario.  (It is assumed that this will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement - this is the case in the recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine)).  If it is used in this way (by cross-reference or otherwise) the Clause?may require amendment.
133 	Consider whether other Finance Documents should not require Majority Lender consent to be amended.
134 	Include if the optional Clause 30.11 (Pro rata interest settlement) is included
135 	Users should consider the extent to which an amendment or waiver relating to a deferral of any amount under the mandatory prepayment provisions in Clause 13 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation) should require all Lender or Majority Lender consent.  The language in square brackets should be included if the commercial agreement is that such amendments or waivers are to require Majority Lender consent only.  Note that the extent to which any amendments or waivers which change or relate to Clause 13 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation) itself are addressed in paragraph (h) of Clause 42.3 (All Lender matters) and any sensitivities are likely to be similar.  See the footnote to that paragraph. 
136 	Users should consider the extent to which amendments and waivers which change or relate to the mandatory prepayment provisions in Clause?13 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation) should require all Lender or Majority Lender consent. A number of drafting options are provided and users should consider which, if any, of these options are suitable in the context of the relevant transaction and sensitivities which they may have.  For example, an individual Lender may be sensitive to the consequences of being unwillingly bound by a Majority Lender decision in respect of a waiver of, or amendment to: (i) any threshold levels set under Clause 13.2 (Disposal, Insurance and Acquisition Proceeds and Excess Cashflow); and (ii) the Obligors' obligation to prepay the Facilities on a change of control, flotation or sale of all the Group's assets under Clause 13.1 (Exit).
137 	This paragraph?may be removed if the Intercreditor Agreement covers this area.  (Clause?28 (Consents, Amendments and Override) of the recommended form of LMA Intercreditor Agreement for Leveraged Acquisition Finance Transactions (Senior/Mezzanine) is intended to cover this area).
138 	Insert if Clause?42.6 (Structural Adjustment) is included.
139 	If paragraph?(b) of Clause?42.7 (Excluded Commitments) is not included consider whether a snooze/lose concept should apply to this Clause?42.5 (Replacement of Screen Rate). 
140 	The extent to which any amendments to the Transaction Security and guarantees should be included in the Structural Adjustment concept should be considered on a transaction specific basis, together with the extent of any qualification.
141 	Users should note that this provision may not be appropriate in all cases for Lenders which are not Defaulting Lenders. Consider also whether there are any provisions which cannot be waived or amended using this provision for Lenders which are not Defaulting Lenders.
142 	Insert agreed time period.
143 	Include to the extent that paragraph?(d) is included in the definition of "Defaulting Lender".
144 	Insert agreed time period.
145 	Include if optional Clause?30.10 (Security over Lenders' rights) is included.
146 	Include this reference if the optional paragraph?(b)(vii) of Clause?43.2 (Disclosure of Confidential Information) is included.
147 	Term/Revolver etc.
148 	This wording has been included to ensure that disclosure is made only for the purposes of enabling a numbering service provider to allocate an identification number to a syndicated facility agreement, one or more facilities made available under such facility agreement or any Obligor party to such facility agreement.  The purpose of disclosure is not therefore to enable products that are directly or indirectly related to a facility agreement, its facilities or its Obligors to be allocated an identification number.
149 	The information listed in paragraph?(a) reflects the information that is likely to be required to enable a numbering service provider ("NSP") to assign identification numbers/codes to this Agreement, the Facilities and their ranking.  Disclosure has been restricted to descriptive information about the Facility Agreement (including changes to that information) for two main reasons.  Firstly, because once delivered to the NSP that information will not be subject to any confidentiality obligations on the part of the NSP or subscribers to the NSP.  It has been assumed that as the NSP needs to disclose the information to its subscribers they would not be prepared to sign up to a confidentiality undertaking or require their subscribers to do so to protect Borrower confidential information.  However, no dialogue has been had with NSPs in this regard.
	The second reason for restricting the information that can be disclosed to NSPs is to limit the risk of that information being unpublished price-sensitive or inside-information (meaning, if it were known to the public it would be likely to have an effect on the price of securities issued by the relevant Borrower that are publicly traded).  If unpublished price-sensitive or inside information were disclosed to a NSP (with or without the consent of the Borrower) by a Lender in circumstances where that information will be disclosed only to subscribers of the NSP (and not to the public), that Lender and the individuals concerned could be guilty of an offence under the insider dealing/market abuse regime in the UK.  Restricting the information that can be disclosed by Lenders to NSP's to relatively anodyne and descriptive information helps to minimise the risk that the information will be unpublished price-sensitive or inside information.
	However, because of the potential seriousness of this issue, because it is possible to envisage circumstances where all or part of the information specified in paragraph?(a) may be unpublished price-sensitive or inside information and because only the Obligors can know with certainty whether any of that information is unpublished price-sensitive or inside information, the permission also requires the Obligors to represent to the Lenders that none of that information is unpublished price-sensitive information.  The representation is contained in paragraph?(c) as a means of ensuring reasonable steps have been taken to avoid inside or price-sensitive information being selectively disclosed with no confidentiality restrictions.
	In most cases where the relevant Obligor has publicly traded securities, the information that is listed in paragraph?(a) would, in any event, need to be disclosed by that Obligor in accordance with the UK disclosure requirements on issuers of listed securities and so the representation should not be onerous for such Obligors.
150	This requirement has been limited to the Agent on the assumption that if the Agent requests an identification number, it will, in any event, require all Parties to use that number in communications etc.  If this is not the case, this clause?can be deleted.
151 	This wording is intended to make non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the agreement subject to English law.  However, if the document is used in a cross-border transaction where different transaction documents are governed by different governing laws, consider whether it is appropriate, in the context of that transaction, for English law to apply to non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the transaction documents which are not governed by English law.
152 	Users should consider the extent to which this Clause?may require amendment in light of the decision of the French Cour de cassation in Mme X v Rothschild.  For a discussion of the issues involved, see the LMA note entitled "Jurisdiction Clauses?in LMA facility documentation" (available through the LMA website).
153 	To the extent that the square bracketed wording relating to non-contractual obligations in Clause?47 (Governing law) is included, this wording should be included in paragraph?(a) of Clause?48.1 (Jurisdiction of English Courts).
154 	If no Original Lender is a UK Non-Bank Lender, delete the words in square brackets from the heading of this Part.
155 	Each of these must be included if the Original Lender holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme and wishes that scheme to apply to the Agreement.
156 	If no Original Lender is a UK Non-Bank Lender, delete this part of the Schedule and all references to it in the body of the Agreement.
157	If no Hedge Counterparties are Party to this Agreement at signing delete this part of the Schedule and all references to it in the body of the Agreement.
158 	The extent to which Mandatory Costs are chargeable to the borrower on any transaction, and the method for calculating any such Mandatory Costs, is a matter for commercial agreement between the parties.  Users should refer to the LMA note entitled "Withdrawal of the Mandatory Costs Schedule" (available through the LMA website) for a discussion of some of the issues involved in formulating any calculation methodology.
159 	Delete as applicable - each New Lender is required to confirm which of these three categories it falls within.
160	Include if New Lender comes within paragraph?(i)(B) of the definition of Qualifying Lender in Clause?19.1 (Definitions).

***	Delete as applicable.

*****	Include only if the transfer includes the transfer of a Revolving Facility Commitment/a participation in the Revolving Facility.
161 	This clause?should follow the approach adopted as regards non-contractual obligations in Clause?47 (Governing Law).  This should be done (and this footnote deleted) before the Agreement is signed.
162 	If the Assignment Agreement is used in place of a Transfer Certificate in order to avoid a novation of rights/obligations for reasons relevant to a civil jurisdiction, local law advice should be sought to check the suitability of the Assignment Agreement due to the assumption of obligations contained in paragraph?2(c).  This issue should be addressed at Primary documentation stage.  This footnote is not intended to be included in the scheduled form of Assignment Agreement in the signed Facilities Agreement.
163 	Delete as applicable - each New Lender is required to confirm which of these three categories it falls within.
164 	Include only if New Lender is a UK Non-Bank Lender ie falls within paragraph?(i)(B) of the definition of Qualifying Lender in Clause?19.1 (Definitions).

172 	The current form of LMA Confidentiality Letter (Seller) or Confidentiality Letter (Purchaser) for the secondary trading of loans should be included in this Schedule.  In the case where primary syndication takes place after the Facility Agreement is signed, the current LMA Confidentiality and Front Running Letter should also be included to avoid confusion over which form of confidentiality letter is appropriate.
173 	When completing the timetables, not all times/days should be determined by reference to the Utilisation Date.  In certain cases (ie in relation to Clause?8.2 (Unavailability of a Currency)) the time inserted should be determined by reference to the Quotation Day or the relevant day during the Interest Period.
174 	NB may need to be renumbered if paragraphs?(c) and (d) of Clause?6.5 (Issue of Letters of Credit) are not included.
175 	NB may need to be renumbered if paragraphs?(c) and (d) of Clause?6.5 (Issue of Letters of Credit) are not included.
